Open your web browser to Google@UH Gmail.    Login to your Google@UH email account with your UH username and password.    Click the gear icon  in the upper right, then select Settings.        Figure 1 - Gmail Settings Menu    In the General tab, scroll down to the Vacation responder: section. Select Vacation responder on .    Enter the starting date and ending date in the appropriate First Day: and Last Day: boxes.    Enter the subject and body of your message in the corresponding Subject: and Message: boxes.&nbsp;        Figure 2 - Sample Vacation Responder Settings    [Optional] Check the box next to Only send a response to people in my Contacts if you don't want everyone who emails you to know that you're away from your mail.    [Optional] If you use Google Apps, you'll also see an option to only send a response to people in the University of Hawaii (hawaii.edu). If you check both of these boxes, only people who are in your contacts and your domain will receive the automatic response.    Click Save Changes button.NotesYour vacation responder starts at 12:00 AM on the start date (First Day) and ends at 11:59 PM on the end date (Last Day), unless you end it earlier.In general, your reply is only sent once to people who email you. However, if the same person contacts you again after four days and your vacation responder is still on, Gmail will send another vacation response to remind the person that you're away from your email. Your vacation response will start over each time you edit it, so if someone receives your initial vacation response, and then emails you again after you've edited the subject or body of the message, he or she will receive the edited response.Messages classified as spam and messages addressed to a mailing list you subscribe to will not receive a vacation response.Excerpts from http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=25922Tips    Test your vacation message before leaving on vacation, preferably when you don't receive a lot of email.            Temporarily change the start date to the current day (of testing).        Save changes.        Send yourself a test message.        If all is well, reset vacation option to proper start date and save changes.            You could have a pre-defined &quot;away from my email&quot; message saved but have Vacation responder off.            On your last day to check email regularly, set Vacation Responder on.        Ensure that your start and end dates are correct.        Save your changes."

    "question": "What is a first.last email alias?",
    "answer": "It is a professional representation of your email address that uses your first name and last name. For example, John Doe's current email address is jdoe@hawaii.edu. With first.last, John's email alias could be john.doe@hawaii.edu. It is also a more definitive way of identifying yourself to another colleague where they might know your first and last name, but not your eight character email name. This is an optional service being offered to faculty and staff."

  "512": {
    "question": "May I pick any name for my first.last email alias?",
    "answer": "You may have only one first.last email alias active at any one time. The first.last email alias should be closely related to your full name. The following are guidelines for selecting your first.last email alias:    first.last    first.last.generation    first.m.last    first.m.last.generation    first.middle.last    first.middle.last.generation    middle.last    middle.last.generationYour first.last email alias may only use alphabets (a-z), dash and/or period. The first.last email alias is not case-sensitive so Jane.Doe@hawaii.edu is the same as jane.doe@hawaii.edu. The &quot;last&quot; part of your selected first.last email alias must reflect your legal last name on record, so if your last name is Doe, Doe must be the &quot;last&quot; part of your first.last email alias. Offensive language will not be allowed in your first.last email alias even if it spells out your name. Alternative first.last email alias combinations can be considered.Name Changes and First.Last AliasIf your name has changed, you have the option to switch from the first.last email alias that was based on your previous name, and activate a new first.last email alias based on your new name. For example, Jane Doe has Jane.Doe@hawaii.edu but they have changed their name to Jane Smith. They can choose to activate Jane.Smith@hawaii.edu (if it is available) and their Jane.Doe@hawaii.edu alias would be removed.Additional AssistanceIf you have any questions, or run into any problems regarding your UH Username, feel free to call the ITS Help Desk at (808) 956-8883 or toll-free from neighbor islands at (800) 558-2669 for assistance."

    "question": "Basic Online Services for Students, Faculty, and Staff",
    "answer": "Your UH Username is valid for the duration of your affiliation with the University of Hawaii. Students must be currently enrolled in good standing; faculty and staff must be current employees of UH. For eligibility requirements and procedures for obtaining an UH Username, see UH Username Practices.Your UH Username provides you access to the following online services:Note: This list of services is not exhaustive. There are many other online services that leverage the UH Username for access.    Google@UH - Your UH Username provides access to Google Apps for Education, which include Google@UH Gmail, Google@UH Calendar, and Google@UH Drive.            Gmail - Your UH Username becomes your Internet email address. For example, John Doe with UH Username jdoe will have an email address of jdoe@hawaii.edu. You can access your UH email on any computer on the Internet with a Web browser using Google@UH Gmail. Client software, such as Thunderbird (Mac or PC) or Outlook (PC), can also be used to access your email account, and you can even setup your UH email account on a mobile device.        Calendar - Your UH Username is also linked to Google@UH Calendar, which is a fully-featured calendaring solution. You can access your calendars using a web browser, or setup your calendars on a mobile device.        Drive - Your UH Username provides access to Google@UH Drive, which can be used for file storage, file sharing, and collaboration.        Google@UH Storage Policy - Your Google@UH storage quota is based on your current affiliation. https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1882        Google@UH Service Availability Matrix - Your UH username can also provide access to Google Consumer Apps. Some features are only available for Faculty/Staff licenses. View the Service Availability Matrix            Campus Wireless - Each campus offers a wireless network for faculty, staff, and students to utilize, with your UH Username and password being used for access.    MyUH - This academic portal contains links to many online services for UH faculty, staff, and students.    Password Administration - You can manage your password for your UH Username online. Password administration also includes management of your secret questions and answers. You can fall back on these if they are wisely chosen to allow you to recover from losing or forgetting your password.    First.Last Email Alias - Faculty and Staff may designate a first.last email address alias for use on business cards, or other professional purposes. For example, John Doe may designate john.doe@hawaii.edu as an alias for his regular UH email address, jdoe@hawaii.edu. This service is not currently available for students.    Spam Filtering - Spam is unsolicited email messages sent to your email account. Spam is also referred to as &quot;unsolicited commercial email&quot; and &quot;unsolicited bulk email&quot;. They range from harmless advertising to potentially offensive (complete with pictures). Spam is very similar to &quot;junk mail&quot; that you receive in your regular postal mailbox. See Spam at the University of Hawaii.    Software Downloads&nbsp;- Faculty, staff, and students of the UH community may download software online, including anti-virus software for PCs and Macs. ITS licenses anti-virus protection software for all institutional and personal computers. Take the time to install the software and keep up with the free updates supplied via the Web.    UH Online Directory - An online directory of UH faculty and staff is provided to students, faculty and staff to help members of the University keep in touch.    Personal Webpages - Your UH Username permits you to create a personal homepage on the World Wide Web. John Doe with UH Username jdoe would create a homepage at http://www2.hawaii.edu/~jdoe.    Student Employment - Students and UH employers have access to online services using their UH Username and depending on the requirements of Student Employment offices. Visit http://www.hawaii.edu/sece for more information.    Mailing Lists - A mailing list is a tool for communicating with a specific group of people via email. Mailing lists are useful for discussions and announcements. Faculty and staff may request a mailing list for a topic directly related to the academic and/or administrative work of the University of Hawaii.&nbsp;There is normally no charge for a UH Username or the above services. Please note, however, for Non-Credit students: due to the manual processes of creating and maintaining UH Usernames for non-credit students, there will be a nominal assessed fee to create accounts for programs that want their students to have a UH Username for email or access privileges. Previously ITS was absorbing the costs, but regrettably now needs to pass on the costs. Fee is set at $10 per UH Username per semester of full service. For additional questions, please call the ITS Help Desk and ask to escalate to a staff member.ResourcesPassword Administration: http://www.hawaii.edu/usernameEmail Services: http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/563First.Last Email Alias: http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/511Spam at the University of Hawaii: http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/571MyUH: http://myuh.hawaii.eduSoftware Downloads: http://www.hawaii.edu/softwareOnline Directory Listing: http://www.hawaii.edu/dirPersonal Web Pages: http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/694Student Employment: http://www.hawaii.edu/seceMailing Lists: http://www.hawaii.edu/its/listRequestUNIX System: http://www.hawaii.edu/itsdocs/cen/unxbasic.pdfref: http://www.hawaii.edu/infotech/uhusername.html"

    "question": "How safe is my email from computer viruses?",
    "answer": "&nbsp;Gmail automatically scans every attachment when it's delivered to you, each time you open a message, and attachments you send to check for viruses. This helps to protect everyone who uses Gmail, and prevents the spread of viruses.If our system is unable to scan certain files, you'll see an error reading 'Oops... the virus scanner has a problem right now.' You'll have the option to try again later or to download the attachment at your own risk. Please note that if Gmail can't scan the contents of the file, we can't guarantee that it's safe to view.http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=25760&nbsp;ITS Tip: There are two ways to protect your email.    If you use an email service that does not have an anti-virus scanner, you may set up your UH Email Account to automatically scan and forward your email before you read it on your unprotected email service.      How to forward email on your UH Email Account    Google@UH users:  Refer to the instructions at Ask Us 1208.            Login to Google@UH        Click on the Gear icon located on the upper right-hand corner.        Select Mail settings.        Click on the Forwarding and POP/IMAP tab        Click the Add a forwarding address button        Type the email address you wish to forward to and click Next.        Click the Proceed button after verifying that the address you typed is correct.        Select the radio button to Forward a copy of incoming mail to and select the correct email address from the drop down.        Optionally you can set forwarding options. By default keep Gmail's copy in the Inbox is selected.        Click Save Changes.        Tell your friends and colleagues to send email to your UH Email Account.  Your email messages will automatically be scanned by the anti-virus scanner on the Google@UH Gmail mail server and will be sent to the email address that you typed into the mail forwarding box.            If you do not want to use the first method, you may choose to manually send selected email messages, that you want scanned for viruses, to your UH email account. If the email message appears in your mailbox, the message is okay. If the email message does not appear in your mailbox within 15 minutes, the message probably contained a known virus and was deleted by the anti-virus scanner.&nbsp;"

    "question": "In Brief: Differences Between a Virus, Worm, and Trojan Horse",
    "answer": "Please keep in mind that these definitions may change as computer viruses become more complex. As of this revision, the computer virus authors are combining two or more viruses together to make one new virus. The new virus combines the features of each virus into one so that the virus will slip past the anti-virus software. It is very important to keep your anti-virus software updated.VirusA computer virus is a program that is designed to replicate itself and spread from file to file, usually attaching itself to applications. When this application is run, it can infect other files on a user's disk. By definition, human interaction is necessary for a virus to spread to another user's files. This can be performed by downloading files, trading diskettes with others, copying files to/from file servers, or sending email attachments. To combat a virus, be sure to use anti-virus software like McAfee's VirusScan or Norton Anti-virus from Symantec.WormA computer worm also infects other computers, but it is spread to other computers on a network automatically and without the action of humans. This allows computer worms to spread more rapidly than computer viruses. A worm doesn't alter or delete files but instead they reside in memory, eat up system resources, and slow down your computer. To protect against a worm, networked users must keep up with operating system patches and updates and be aware of any suspicious traffic.Trojan HorseA Trojan Horse is a program that initially appears useful or benign and fools a user into running it. But while it runs, it could be allowing &quot;back door&quot; access to your computer by hackers or destroying files on your hard disk. For protection against a Trojan Horse, users must be suspicious of any unknown program and be sure it is safe before running it.&nbsp;"

    "question": "Even with all this, I still receive spam!",
    "answer": "Spammers are very aggressive in finding new ways to get their spam through any protective measures. ITS is making a concerted effort to isolate spam email before you receive it. But given differences in perception, there will never be a way to automatically identify 100% of spam without also blocking some amount of email that would be considered legitimate. It is very important that spam blocking is not overly aggressive such that legitimate email is also blocked. There are other emerging approaches to dealing with spam. Some involve the use of specialized or single-use email addresses and many of which require some amount of manual intervention at least once on the part of the sender or receiver to identify legitimate messages.

    "question": "What can I do about spam?",
    "answer": "Look over your Inbox and manually delete messages that seem suspicious before you begin reading your new messages. Examples of suspicious messages include:            messages with missing or strange subject lines        messages with attachments that you were not expecting                Minimize any unnecessary public display of your email address in order to limit your exposure to spammers who &quot;harvest&quot; email addresses off the Web. This is an unfortunate trade-off that each person needs to make for themselves, but addresses that are never seen are less susceptible to spam.        Most current email client software have some form of spam blocking built in. You can setup your email client so that it either marks suspicious messages as spam or moves these messages to a separate folder. Please be sure to test these settings very carefully to ensure that you do not create false positives and lose emails that are important to you.        Do not reply to spam messages asking the spammers to stop; this will confirm that your email address is valid.        Disable remote image or HTML image loading in your email client.        It is critical that you turn off the message preview pane if you are using an email client such as Thunderbird or Outlook. This will help prevent you from inadvertently opening a spam message.        Report spam sent from a hawaii.edu address to uhabuse@hawaii.edu.  Please include a copy of the message with full mail headers.

    "question": "Network Etiquette",
    "answer": "Certain situations call for proper protocol to be observed. In bowling, one does not interrupt the person bowling in adjacent lanes by throwing the ball while they are already in the process of doing so. In tennis, returning a ball that is obviously out is considered poor form. On the Internet, sending unsolicited or irrelevant material, especially if done in a widespread fashion, is of the utmost rudeness.Veteran users of the Internet expect others, especially newcomers, to learn and observe proper network etiquette or netiquette. Here are the most common--yet grave--faux pas one can commit on the Internet:Sending chain mail: Unfortunately this annoying activity has made its way into email. Chain mail greatly upsets and annoys those who receive it, regardless of whether the recipient believes in it or not. It simply boils down to misused and wasted computing resources.Sending irrelevant email to one or more mailing lists (also known as &quot;spamming&quot;): People subscribe to mailing lists because they want to participate in discussions and receive information related to the topic of the list. Because mail processing requires the message to be appended to each individual's mailbox, this type of netiquette violation wastes an incredible amount of computer and network resources. Furthermore, because an intrusion on their personal mailbox has occurred, users will react and reply to the offender with usually not-so-kind words.Sending email to a random number of users on a system: This is exactly the same as the previous type of offense with the exception that instead of a subject-specific mailing list, mail is sent to a random number of users on one or more systems. Everything we said about the previous type of offense applies to this type just as well.Posting an article to a Usenet newsgroup whose contents have nothing to do with the newsgroup's topic: Unfortunately, when this happens, the irrelevant article is often sent to more than one newsgroup, magnifying the offense and causing a barrage of reactions to be sent back and forth across the Internet. Although postings about controversial topics, commercial advertising, and promotion of private interest tend to draw the most clamor for resolution, seemingly valid and innocuous postings like a survey about email usage also draw angry reactions from the Internet.Netiquette violations do a lot more than raise eyebrows. Those who get upset will reply and because a large audience is usually involved, the number of responses traveling back and forth across the Internet take up precious bandwidth that could have been used for more worthwhile traffic. An overwhelming number of replies also puts stress on the system where the unwanted message originated. System managers need to monitor their system's well-being and have to spend time responding to complaints from angry users who demand that the individual who sent the unsolicited message be immediately brought to justice. A good day's work can quickly be spent doing damage control caused by bad network etiquette. Therefore, exercise restraint before sending a reply to the offender or a complaint to the system manager because there is a good chance that someone else has already done so.The Internet's spirit of harmonious, free-flowing information exchange that researchers, educators, and professionals have come to love and expect is constantly being challenged by an ever increasing population brought about by media coverage and commercial hype about the so-called information superhighway. To put it in terms of this overused buzzword, new drivers jump onto the information superhighway without proper driver education instilled in them. Consider this article a first lesson in Internet driver education.Observing the simple network etiquette rule of not sending unsolicited or irrelevant material to a widespread audience makes the Internet a more productive and pleasant place for all of us.For more information on network etiquette, refer to the following Web site: http://www.albion.com/netiquette/In addition, view the UH Executive Policy E2.210 &quot;Use and Management of Information Technology Resources&quot;."

    "question": "Budgeting for Departmental Computers",
    "answer": "Departments should expect to spend between $800-$1200 per CPU. Plan on upgrading CPU's every three to four years. Departments should annually budget enough to upgrade a third or fourth of existing computers. By upgrading a fraction of departmental computers every year, departments can avoid large outlays needed to upgrade the entire staff all at once.Additional CostsMonitors will add $150-$1000 more per CPU, but often times you can save money by keeping your existing monitor rather than upgrading to a new one.Expect to spend $100-$150 for a good inkjet printer for personal use. Laser printers will cost $400-$2500. Departments can save costs by buying laser printers with built-in network cards and sharing the printer among several staff members.Software such as Microsoft Office will add an additional $50-$100 through ITS Site Licensing.Training classes for the latest software will run $100-$200 per class.  Classes are available from  Outreach College or check the ITS Training schedule for available free classes.ref: http://www.hawaii.edu/its/micro/pc/budgeting.html"

Other examples of devices excluded from Supported Computing Sevices:    Departmental computer lab, departmental classroom, or departmental audio/visual devices and equipment    Routers, wireless access points, hotspots, network attached storage (NAS) devices, and other networking equipment external to the University-maintained wired and wireless networks (switches and hubs excluded)    Digital cameras, video cameras, capture cards, and network cameras    Single-board computer (SBC) or single-board microcontroller (SBM) devices (such as Raspberry Pi, Arduino, etc.)    Internet of Things (IoT) devices including casting or streaming devices used for non-University related business    Video game consoles, hand-held gaming devices, etc.The ITS Help Desk provides &ldquo;best effort&rdquo; support for computing devices configured to use a foreign language. Supported users with these computing devices are encouraged to set their device&rsquo;s language to English when seeking support, or to check within their department for other faculty/staff with similar configurations for help. Below are some resources within the University of Hawaii for foreign language support:    The College of Arts, Languages, and Letters provides limited help and maintains computer labs with foreign language support built-in to Windows which are available to their college faculty and staff free of charge or to others for a fee.    UH Hilo maintains a website for the Hawaiian Language at https://www.olelo.hawaii.edu/.If you have information on additional sources of foreign language support that you'd like to share, please email help@hawaii.edu.Departmental Computer Labs and ClassroomsUnfortunately, the ITS Help Desk does not have the resources necessary to provide cost-free support for computing devices purchased for departmental computer labs, departmental classrooms, or departmental audio/visual setups, nor can the ITS Help Desk manage custom or unsupported departmental infrastructure. It is the responsibility of the department to provide the necessary staffing and resources to support these types of computing devices and/or infrastructure. ITS may be contracted to provide support for these devices for a fee.&nbsp;&ldquo;Best Effort&rdquo; SupportThe ITS Help Desk may provide &ldquo;best effort&rdquo; support to Supported Users seeking assistance with unsupported software or devices. The ITS Help Desk will attempt &ldquo;best effort&rdquo; problem resolution for no more than one hour within the limits of the collective knowledge of the ITS Help Desk staff. This &ldquo;best effort&rdquo; support does not extend to the (re)installation of unsupported operating systems, the configuration/setup of unsupported software (beyond basic installation), nor the configuration/setup of routers, wireless access points, print servers, network cameras, IoT devices, and other excluded devices.&nbsp;Should problem resolution either:    require knowledge beyond what the ITS Help Desk staff currently have,    exceed one hour of work time to resolve, or    be unattainable after exhausting all reasonable avenues of problem troubleshooting,then the problem will be deemed unresolvable and no further action will be taken to troubleshoot.&nbsp;Operating System (OS) Software SupportThe ITS Help Desk will repair, reinstall, or troubleshoot problems with the following computer Operating Systems:    Supported Windows versions    Supported macOS versionsIf reinstallation of an OS and/or reformatting of a hard drive are determined to be necessary, an ITS Help Desk Technician may provide assistance. Users should have their own license key available for the Technician, or if the OS was purchased through one of the UH Site License programs, users should make arrangements to have the license key(s) and installation media on-hand at the time of the scheduled appointment.&nbsp;Supported Usersare generally responsible for backing up any necessary data they need on their computer and are encouraged to consider an appropriate backup strategy. The ITS Help Desk can assist with data backup and restore only if time and resources permit, and will require that a Supported User present a detailed list of data on the computing device that needs to be backed up, as well as appropriate and sufficiently sized media onto which this data can be moved/copied. The ITS Help Desk Technician will not be responsible for data erased from a computing device that was not explicitly specified for backup prior to an OS reinstallation.&nbsp;Note: Depending on the reason for OS repair or reinstallation, data backup and restore may not be possible. The ITS Help Desk encourages all users to maintain their own backups in the unfortunate event of data loss.&nbsp;Software SupportA list of ITS Supported Software is posted at https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/575.&nbsp;Limited Hardware SupportOn-site hardware support is limited to University-owned and operated equipment.&nbsp;CAUTION: Equipment under warranty should be checked with the vendor first, as some warranties may be invalidated if a non-authorized person attempts to repair the equipment.&nbsp;An ITS Help Desk Technician can install or troubleshoot on-site standard computer hardware components (e.g. DIMMs, video cards, wired or wireless Ethernet adapters, m.2 or sata storage devices, optical disc drives, etc.). The Technician can install or remove hardware components from a computer, but not necessarily repair faulty hardware components nor their integrated circuitry.&nbsp;Note: Laptops often have different or non-standard hardware configurations or requirements and limited serviceability when compared to typical ATX desktop computers. Hardware support for laptops is generally &quot;best effort&quot; only.&nbsp;Server SupportA designated staff server administrator is required for any server hosted at UH. The administrator is responsible for the maintenance of server hardware, any necessary software, management of user accounts, actively applying security and OS patches, backups, and general troubleshooting of the server. If a department has no designated staff server administrator, and that server has any problems with compromise, viruses, or security, ITS reserves the right to remove the server from the UH Network.&nbsp;For information on ITS-provided virtual server or co-location services, please visit https://hawaii.edu/askus/1181.&nbsp;"

    "question": "Securing your Computer",
    "answer": "If your computer has been compromised, Information Technology Services (ITS) reserves the right to block your IP/MAC Address from connecting to the network in order to protect the integrity of the University of Hawaii network. Information on getting your computer unblocked can be found at: https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/686. For Manoa campus, please call your IT department or the ITS Help Desk for additional assistance.The information below will provide you with information on how to best secure your computer from being compromised by unauthorized intrusions and viruses. Please note that despite one's efforts, there is no product that will stop a determined hacker.Basics    Keep your software up-to-date. Periodically, companies will release updates that provide software enhancements and security fixes. For Microsoft Windows, Microsoft provides an auto-update feature. You should also install security updates for application software such as Microsoft Office, Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Reader, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, etc.    Install anti-virus software and update the virus definition file regularly. Active University of Hawaii faculty, staff, and students may download anti-virus software.    For email attachments, if you have any hesitations, please do not open attachments you receive. Email attachments are a common source of viruses. Gmail automatically scans attachments for viruses when the attachment is delivered to you, when you open the attachment, and when you attach a file.    For further protection, a firewall product might be needed. Most desktop systems don't necessarily have to have this, as it requires someone with some technical knowledge and time to manage well. However, firewalls will lower the odds of an unauthorized access to your computer and might be necessary if the data is extremely confidential and requires additional security. It should be noted that with a firewall, ITS standard network troubleshooting techniques can no longer be used (firewalls will also block our efforts to ensure that your Internet connections are working). Users are required to have their own IT Specialist to troubleshoot their firewall and any network connections for their computers behind a firewall.Security Updates and Operating System updatesMicrosoft Windows has an auto-update feature. This auto-update feature periodically connects to the Microsoft website to see if they are any updates to your Windows Operating System or Microsoft Office (if installed). If any updates are available, the auto-update feature will let you know. It will then give you an option to install, install later, or deny the new updates. To manually check for updates:    For Windows 10: Open the Start Menu and click on the settings wheel, Update &amp; Security settings, in the Windows Update-Update Status click on the updates button.macOS also has an auto-update feature through the Mac App Store. Like Microsoft Windows, the auto-update feature will periodically check the Apple website for updates. If updates are found, the feature will notify you. If you would like to manually check for updates, click on the apple icon in the top left corner of the menu bar and click &ldquo;App Store&hellip;&rdquo;, then navigate to the &ldquo;Updates&rdquo; tab. You can also visit https://support.apple.com/downloads.MS Office UpdatesMicrosoft releases updates for their Microsoft Office software. These updates provide feature enhancements, bug fixes, and security fixes. Microsoft Office updates are included with Windows Updates.Email ScanningIf you use a departmental email server, please check with your IT support person to see if anti-virus protection is provided. If anti-virus protection is not available, you can still protect your department issued email account by forwarding email through your Google@UH email account first. In addition to setting up email forwarding you should advertise your @hawaii.edu account so that email messages will be routed through the Google@UH email server and scanned by the anti-virus and SPAM scanner before it reaches your department-issued email address.Anti-VirusActive UH faculty, staff, and students are eligible to install anti-virus software provided by ITS. NOTE: UH faculty, staff, and students must remove the software from any personal computers once they are no longer affiliated with the University. You may download it here.FirewallAlthough, ITS does not support any particular firewall product, there are several you may want to try. If you feel that you may have discovered a firewall software that ITS should test and support, please send email to help@hawaii.edu.PasswordsAll user accounts on your computer should have a password, especially your Administrator or Power User accounts. If you are mapping any drives from/to your computer, please make sure they are password protected. Some viruses propagate via unprotected drive mappings. The following password guidelines article can help you select a strong (difficult to guess or to break) password:&nbsp; https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/705EncryptionIf you keep any sensitive information on your computer, the information should be encrypted. Current versions of Windows and MacOS operating systems have built-in encryption features.&nbsp; For more details on using Windows encryption, please read:&nbsp; https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1285.&nbsp; For MacOS encyption, please read: https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/676.There are also third-party encryption applications like GPG.Physical SecurityAccess control:&nbsp; Physical access to machines should be controlled and monitored.&nbsp; Unknown individuals should NOT be able to walk up to any unattended computer unchallenged.&nbsp; In open environments, physical lockdown devices (cable security locks, CPU locks, etc.) should be considered.&nbsp; Lock individual office doors at the end of the day.&nbsp; Provide as many layers of defense as possible.Partitioning of physical environments into security zones:&nbsp; More sensitve computers should be located in areas that can be more tightly locked down.Alarm systems:&nbsp; Depending on the sensitivity of the information stored on servers and computers, 3rd party alarm systems may be a consideration.Education:&nbsp; People are the best alarms.&nbsp; If someone does not belong in the area, they should be physically challenged:&nbsp; ask the unknown individual if they need help, what business they have, who sent them, and call to check credentials (but call a number from a trusted source).&nbsp; You can always ask them to return at a pre-arranged date and time.&nbsp; If it's legitimate, they will return.BackupsMake regular backups of your critical data (at a minimum) and test your backups to ensure that they are readable. ITS supported versions of Windows and macOS have a backup features built-in to the operating system. To learn more about each, visit their websites at:Windows: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17127/windows-back-up-restoremacOS: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250&nbsp;last updated: August 2018"

    "question": "Backing Up Thunderbird Emails for MacOS",
    "answer": "Please note that this documentation assumes you have set up your email in Thunderbird with IMAP or POP3.  If you do not already have IMAP/POP3 enabled in your email address settings you will first need to enable less secure apps in Google.  Instructions to do so may be found here.  Once enabled, you may go here for instructions on how to enable IMAP/POP3 for your gmail account.  If you are using Gmail 2-step verification, you may need to create an app-specific password when signing into your gmail account.  Instructions to do so can be found here.  If you are using POP3, you will need to update your authentication setting to use OAuth2 for both incoming and outgoing server settings.  This is done by clicking on &ldquo;Configure manually&hellip;&rdquo; at the bottom left window after entering in your email address.General Information on Mozilla ThunderbirdMozilla Thunderbird will automatically create a Thunderbird Profile which stores your email data and Thunderbird configurations.  If you would like to create a backup of your email data you will first have to locate your Thunderbird Profile.  Once located you will have two options: copying your entire profile, or copying just your email data.  Instructions on how to locate your Thunderbird Profile are included below.  All screenshots taken in this article were done in MacOS Catalina version 10.15.4.Locating Your Thunderbird ProfileTo locate your profile, click on Help within the Thunderbird menu bar at the top.  From there, click on Troubleshooting Information which should open a new tab with that name.  Under the Application Basics header there will be a field labeled Profiles with a link, &ldquo;about:profiles&rdquo; next to it.  Clicking on that link will open a new tab called About Profiles and will display all of the Thunderbird profiles you currently have.  The current profile in use will be indicated by a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; next to the Default Profile field.  Click on the &ldquo;Show in Finder&rdquo; button in the Root Directory field to be taken directly to your profile.Copying Your Entire Thunderbird ProfileOnce you have located your profile folder, you can simply copy and paste the entire folder into a desired location to create a backup.Copying Your Email DataIf you would like to copy just your email data, there are two different ways to go about this.    Copying all of your email data - The steps for this option will differ slightly depending on whether you used IMAP or POP3 when setting up your email account in Thunderbird.    Copying specific email folders to Local Folders - This will require you to set up Local Folders and move mail into them from whichever email folders you would like to backup.&nbsp;The following sections contain the instructions on how to copy your data using the above methods:Copying All Email Data (from an IMAP or POP3 Account)If you have set up your email account using IMAP, your emails will be stored in the &ldquo;ImapMail&rdquo; folder.  You can copy and paste that folder onto a storage device for a backup.    If you have set up your email account using POP3, your emails will be stored in the &ldquo;Mail&rdquo; folder under &ldquo;pop.service-name.com&rdquo;.  The &lsquo;service-name&rsquo; will be the type of account you use, such as Gmail or Yahoo.  You can copy and paste that folder onto a storage device for a backup.Copying Specific Email Folders to Local FoldersInstead of copying all of your emails through your Thunderbird Profile or through email folders for IMAP or POP3, you may instead choose to copy specific email folders in the Thunderbird application to Local Folders that you will need to set up manually and move your email to them.Creating Local FoldersThe first step in moving your mail to your hard drive is to create local mail folders that have the same name as your folders on the mail server.            In the list of folders on the left side pane, click once on &quot;Local Folders&quot; to select it.&nbsp; Go to the &quot;File&quot; menu, select New, then select Folder                      The &quot;Create as a subfolder of&quot; should already be set to &quot;Local Folders&quot;                         In the &quot;Name&quot; box, type UH Email Backup.&nbsp; Click Create Folder.                        If necessary, click on the triangle next to Local Folders to expand it and see your newly created folder.                         Click once on the &quot;UH Email Backup&quot; folder to select it.&nbsp; Go to the &quot;File&quot; menu, select New, the select Subfolder.                               Make sure the &quot;Create as a subfolder of&quot; is set to UH Email Backup.                      In the &quot;Name&quot; box, type Inbox. Click Create Folder.                          Repeat steps 5 - 7 and create folders for all the different folders that you wish to copy off of the server.&nbsp; (E.g. Drafts, Sent, Trash, and whatever else is listed on the left-hand side under your hawaii.edu email address.)        When you are done, if necessary, click on the triangle next to &quot;UH Email Backup&quot; to expand and show what's stored inside.  Your Thunderbird window should look similar to below, except with your information. The next step will be moving the mail to your newly created Local Folders.Moving Mail to Your Local FoldersYou should try the following steps on a small amount of messages first.  Be sure you are comfortable with this process before attempting to move mail from a critical folder such as Sent or Inbox.  Before doing the steps below, please be sure you are not logged into your UH Gmail in a web browser or other computer.    You first have to select the folder that contains the messages you want to move.&nbsp; In this example, we will move messages from the &quot;Inbox&quot; folder.&nbsp; On the left side of the screen, click on the folder &quot;Inbox&quot; that's listed under the &quot;username@hawaii.edu&quot; section (do not select the one under &quot;UH Email Backup&quot;).    Go to the &quot;Edit&quot; menu, select Select, then select All.&nbsp; All the messages in the &quot;meetings&quot; folder will now be selected.&nbsp; If there are a large amount of messages in the folder, do not use &quot;Select All&quot;.&nbsp; Instead, select a portion of the messages by clicking on the first message you want to move, then hold down the shift key and click on the last message you want to move.    Go to the &quot;Message&quot; menu    --&gt; then select Copy To&nbsp; [IMPORTANT: you should copy the messages rather than move them, in case anything goes wrong during the transfer]    --&gt; then select Local Folders    --&gt; then select UH Email Backup    --&gt; then select Inbox (and let go of the mouse button)    The highlighted messages will be moved to the meetings folder.&nbsp; Depending on how many messages you selected to move, this could take some time.    On the left side, select the Inbox folder under the UH Email Backup section and verify the messages are there.&nbsp; Once you have verified that the messages were successfully copied, you may delete them from the server (in other words, delete them from under the &quot;username@hawaii.edu&quot; section).    Repeat steps 1 - 5 for each of the folders that you wish to move off of the server.    /t/t&nbsp;"

    "question": "Dell NASPO ValuePoint (WSCA) Purchasing Procedures",
    "answer": "This document was written specifically for Fiscal Administrators (or which ever individual approves computer purchases for your UH department). It is assumed that a member of your department has followed ITS's instructions for making an online order with Dell and has provided you with the &quot;E-quote&quot; for this order.(An E-quote is a unique reference number associated with an order for computer equipment which has been saved using Dell Premier. Saving the order as an E-quote &quot;locks onto&quot; a price and configuration for up to 90 days. After 90 days, the E-quote is automatically deleted from Dell's system.)To process an order:    The State of Hawaii General Excise Tax is 4.712% for Oahu, 4.166% for neighbor islands. To add this state tax to the price of the order, multiply the Total Price (from the printed order) by 1.04712&nbsp;for Oahu, and 1.0417&nbsp;for neighbor islands.    (Do not include shipping. Dell provides free shipping for departmental purchases.)            Prepare a purchase order for this item using the new price calculated above.&nbsp;&nbsp;Include the NASPO ValuePoint SPO Contract Number 15-05 and Dell Master Agreement Number MNWNC-108 on your purchase order.&nbsp; (Note: your Dell equote will reference contract code WN10AGW which is Dell's internal contract code for SPO contract 15-05.) Please note that although we may use the NASPO ValuePoint contract to purchase, Dell's Higher Ed Team can place your order. Either pricing for NASPO ValuePoint or Dell's Higher Education pricing may be used to purchase UH equipment. However, going through the Higher Ed team is slightly lower as they will accept the lowest price you find, and then waive the shipping cost.            If the department selects a vendor that offers the best value but not the lowest price, you are required to fill out OPRPM Form 95.&nbsp;        Fax the purchase order and the printed E-quote to the UH Dell Premier Team: /tMariah Whittet, Inside Sales Account ManagerPhone: (512) 513-0790 Mariah.Whittet@dell.comWalter Eccles, Account ExecutivePhone: (808) 222-1472Walter.Eccles@dell.com&nbsp;"

    "question": "IT Policy and Guidelines: UH Manoa Wireless Networks",
    "answer": "As with all shared resources of the University, policies and guidelines are established to ensure equitable and reliable access to limited resources for all members of the University community.  The UH Manoa network infrastructure is considered to be a shared resource and as it is extended through the use of wireless network devices, it becomes essential to define and describe how wireless technologies are to be deployed to protect the accessibility and integrity of the entire UH network.  Use of the UH Manoa network (wired and wireless) is governed by UH Executive Policy: E2.210 -- Use and Management of Information Technology Resources.  This document is available on-line at:  http://www.hawaii.edu/infotech/policies/itpolicy.html.This document describes how wireless technologies are to be deployed, administered, and supported at the University of Hawaii Manoa campus.  General information about the UH Manoa wireless infrastructure can be found at: http://www.hawaii.edu/wireless.To ensure the integrity, reliability, and security of the UH Manoa Network, Information Technology Services (ITS) reserves the right to restrict the use of wireless devices and/or determine what devices can be connected to the network and how these devices should be configured.&nbsp;PurposeThis document provides guidelines for deployment and usage of wireless devices on the Manoa Campus.  The guidelines provision a minimum level of wireless security, network reliability and will minimize network interference from other devices utilizing the same wireless frequency spectrum.&nbsp;Scope of this documentThis document is intended to cover any and all wireless devices within the UH Manoa campus.  This includes, but are not limited to, wireless access points, wireless routers, wireless phones, etc.&nbsp;SuitabilityFor data networks, wireless networks should not be considered a replacement for a wired network.  It should be seen only as an extension to the existing wired network for general purpose access in areas of transient use such as common areas.A wireless access point provides shared bandwidth.  As more users connect to the access point, the available bandwidth per user diminishes.  Therefore, wireless networks are not appropriate for high bandwidth applications such as video streaming.  It is most suited for applications such as email and Web browsing.Wireless devices should not be used to access administrative information systems such as FMIS, ISIS/Banner, Peoplesoft, etc. that contain sensitive and confidential information unless using encrypted protocols.ITS reserves the right to restrict access to services and resources that are disruptive to the wireless network, or pose a threat to the University's information security, audit or accreditation status when used from the wireless network.&nbsp;CoverageITS installs and maintains data wireless access in many buildings and public spaces. &nbsp;This wireless coverage will continue to expand as resources become available.  For a more complete coverage map, please refer to: https://manoa.hawaii.edu/campusmap/wireless.php.Data wireless networks in departmentally controlled spaces can be deployed in two ways:1) ITS -installed and managed; or2) self-supported:  departmentally/organizationally installed and managed.  Self-supported wireless networks must be installed  in consultation with ITS to prevent network outages, frequency conflicts, and to maintain the integrity of the UH Network by preventing unauthorized access.&nbsp;Management &amp; SupportFor ITS installed and managed wireless devices in public spaces, ITS will assume responsibility to maintain, update, and upgrade these devices.For ITS-installed and managed wireless devices in departmentally controlled spaces, ITS will assume responsibility to maintain, update, and upgrade these devices.  When consulting ITS, departments will be advised of the cost of installation and maintenance.  In physical spaces shared by more than one organization, ITS will try to work with all organizations to reach a mutually beneficial and agreeable arrangement for all.Where possible, and when requested by departments/faculty, ITS will wireless-enable general purpose classrooms under our Manoa general purpose classroom support effort, on a best effort basis.Requests for assistance with planning for wireless networks can be made by calling the ITS Telecom office at: 956-6033.Self-Supported: If an organization is installing and maintaining their own wireless devices, at a minimum, the device standards &amp; configurations should be: 802.11b standards, configured to be &quot;closed&quot;  and WEP-enabled and preferably, support for LDAP and Radius.Radio Spectrum ManagementThere are many devices which share the same radio spectrum as the UH Wireless Network on the Manoa campus.  This includes, but is not limited to 2.4GHz cordless phones, wireless cameras or speakers which may interfere with the wireless network.   Also a wireless access point using the same frequency range as another unit may cause interference and degrade the quality of the wireless signal.  To prevent such disruptions on the UH Wireless Network, the use of other devices using the 2.4GHz frequency range are banned from areas that are now or may soon have wireless coverage. Non-2.4GHz alternatives are available for most of these other devices.  Also installation of self-supported data wireless access points must be coordinated with ITS to prevent frequency conflicts.SecurityThe wireless infrastructure should not be relied upon as being secure.  While a minimal level of security is provided through user authentication for ITS-managed wireless access points, application and data protection is still the responsibility of the application and data owners.For departmentally deployed wireless networks, wireless access points should be configured to validate their identity (either using their UH Username or a departmental ID) to prevent unauthorized access of the network.Should ITS encounter a device that is interfering with the UH Manoa network infrastructure, ITS will attempt to notify the administrator on a time permitting basis but reserves the right to disconnect the device without notification.  ITS' first priority is to restore the network to its normal operating state.Any person attaching a wireless device to the UH Manoa Network is responsible for the security of the device and for any intentional or unintentional activities from or to the network pathway that the device is using.  Users and system administrators must guard against abuses that disrupt or threaten the network and any systems connected to it."

    "question": "File/Disk Erasing for computer Disposal and/or Transfer",
    "answer": "&nbsp;Securing your dataMost departments will either transfer or dispose of their old computers when they purchase new systems.&nbsp; You will want to protect your documents with sensitive information from being exposed to others that may end up with your old system.&nbsp; If you think that by deleting your files or reformatting your hard drive will be good enough then you should probably read the rest of this document.What is the difference between erase and delete?When you delete a file on a computer it is not actually removed from your hard drive.&nbsp; The system just removes the record of the file&rsquo;s existence from the part of the system that keeps track of where all of your files are located.&nbsp; Think of it this way, you have a piece of paper that you wrote your name, address, phone number on and you decide to throw it in the trash can.&nbsp; Is the information you wrote still on the paper?&nbsp; When you empty the trash can and the garbage is dumped in a land-fill, is the information still on the paper?&nbsp; Of course it is, just because you don't have access to it doesn&rsquo;t mean that the information can&rsquo;t be picked out of&nbsp;the trash and used by someone else.Now think of erase as a more permanent way of disposing your information.&nbsp; It's similar to using a paper shredder or burning the paper.&nbsp; It makes it a lot harder for someone to retrieve the information.&nbsp; In a computer, eraser programs will write 1s and 0s over the file that you are trying to remove.&nbsp; It will usually do this several times to make sure that the information is &ldquo;shredded&rdquo; from the hard drive.&nbsp; Note that it is still possible to recover information after a single pass of erasing.&nbsp;Well I formatted my hard drive so my data is destroyed right?WRONG!&nbsp;Formatting your hard drive is similar to the delete command.&nbsp;It does not actually remove data from your hard drive.&nbsp;All&nbsp;formatting does is create a new file record table to keep track of the files you place on after the format is done.&nbsp; This is the same for the FDISK utility.&nbsp;You can still retrieve the data until you actually write new files over the old data on the hard drive. Are there other ways of removing my data?Yes, the first 2 options will destroy the hard drives (but it will be a permanent way of removing access to information on the hard drive). The 3rd option is a recommended way to erase the data and still use the computer. 1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Physically destroying the drive.&nbsp;This is a good choice when your hard drive has failed, &ldquo;crashed&rdquo;.&nbsp;Remember that even though you can&rsquo;t use the hard drive it still holds the information you put on it.&nbsp; Hard drive&rsquo;s can be disassembled and data can still be retrieved from the drive platters.&nbsp;&nbsp;2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Degaussing the hard drive.&nbsp; Degaussing will demagnetize the fields used to store data on the hard drive.&nbsp; Usually when this method is used the magnetic field is so strong that the hard drive is damaged beyond use.&nbsp;3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It&rsquo;s best to use an eraser program so others can still benefit by being able to use the computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please review&nbsp;&ldquo;Securely Deleting Electronic Information&rdquo; for information on programs and procedures for erasing your files.&nbsp; This document also has information on other electronic storage and devices that you may want to erase before disposal."

    "question": "UH File Drop",
    "answer": "What is UH File Drop?UH File Drop is a service for the UH community for allowing transfer of large files (up to 999MB) to others in UH and/or people unaffiliated with the University.&nbsp;It is recognized that there is a growing need within the University community to share more and larger amounts of information with others.&nbsp;http://www.hawaii.edu/filedrop&nbsp;Is it secure?The file transfer (both in uploading and downloading) is secure, in the sense that &quot;SSL&quot; is used to encrypt the file(s) over the Internet. This should provide sufficient security for most users. However, it's true that in the basic mode of operation, the security of the system depends entirely on the security of the randomly generated URLs used to download the files. It is extremely unlikely that anyone would be able to guess one of these URLs. But there may be other ways for an attacker to learn the download URL, and since in the basic mode of operation that's all we require to download the files, the attacker would gain access to the files.&nbsp;We do offer an additional level of protection, for users exchanging files containing sensitive information. When uploading files, you can check off the &quot;Optional Authentication&quot; checkbox. If this checkbox is selected, the UH user who is the recipient of the transfer (and in this case, the recipient must be a UH user) will have to login before retrieving the files. That is, the recipient must know both the secret URL and the recipient's UH Username and password.&nbsp;How does it work?The basic idea behind this service is simple: we allow people to upload potentially large files to our servers, where they will be stored for a limited period. We generate a random URL which can be used to download the files during that period. Once the files have been completely uploaded, we send an email containing this URL to the address or UH Username you have specified as the recipient. Note that the use of the service must comply with all relevant University policies, including E2.210.This service is provided to the UH community, and is not meant to be open to the general public. However, we do wish to provide the ability for people unaffiliated with the University to use the service to share files with people within UH. In all cases, we require at least one end of the transaction (sender or receiver, that is) to be a UH person. The only practical consequence of this is that for a UH person to send files to a non-UH person, the UH person must use the link on the service home page to login prior to uploading files.&nbsp;Step by Step Upload of files    The sender must go the File Drop webpage to start the process.    &nbsp;        Click on &ldquo;login here&rdquo; for UH users or type in your name and email address if you don&rsquo;t have a UH Username.        &nbsp;        Type in the name and email address of the person that will receive your transferred file.&nbsp;You can also enter in any comments that you wish to pass on.&nbsp;An email with this information and URL will be sent to the person entered into this page.&nbsp;Press the Proceed button to continue.    &nbsp;        Note that you can only enter one recipient name and email address.&nbsp;If you wish to send the same file to multiple people you can leave this page blank so that you can email to everyone at one time.&nbsp;This only works if you have logged in with a UH Username.&nbsp;More information is provided below.        &nbsp;        You will now select the file(s) from your local computer that will be uploaded to our UH File Drop site.&nbsp;Click on the Browse button to find and select the file(s) that you wish to upload.&nbsp;You can also put in a description of the file but this is optional.&nbsp;Note that you can enter up to three files to be transferred but the combined size of all three files must not exceed 999MB.&nbsp;You can setup multiple File Drops if you have more than three files.&nbsp;Just go through the steps again after you finish with this File Drop.&nbsp;Press the &ldquo;Start Upload&rdquo; button when you are done.        &nbsp;        Note the download page in the following screen.&nbsp;This is a randomly generated page and it is sent to the recipient you entered earlier.&nbsp;You can also copy this link and email it to others.    &nbsp;        Copy the link on the page and open up your email program.&nbsp;Enter the people that you wish to receive the file information and in the body of your message paste the link you just copied then send the email when you are done.    &nbsp;        Note that you can &ldquo;Click here&rdquo; if you have more files to upload to the UH File Drop.&nbsp;It will take you back to step 3.        &nbsp;    Step by Step Download of Files    The File Drop service will send an email similar to the one below to the&nbsp;recipient that was entered during the upload process.&nbsp;Your email may look different if the sender sends a personal email.        &nbsp;        Click on the link at the bottom of the screen above.&nbsp;This should open your browser and display the following page.&nbsp;If the sender selected&nbsp;&ldquo;Require authentication&rdquo; you will need to login using your UH Username and password before you will see the following screen.    &nbsp;        Click on the file name to begin the download process.    &nbsp;        &nbsp;        You can either save the file to your local computer or open it.&nbsp;I would suggest that you download the file before opening it.&nbsp;Remember that the file is only on the File Drop site for a short period of time before it is removed.&nbsp;    &nbsp;        That completes the process of sending and receiving files using the UH File Drop service.    &nbsp;    You can get more information by going to the FAQ webpage, http://www.hawaii.edu/filedrop/help."

    "question": "Setting Up Encryption on macOS",
    "answer": "If you have a need to store sensitive data such as social security numbers (SSNs) or student records on your Mac&rsquo;s hard drive, you should make sure this data is encrypted. The following are two suggested methods for encrypting data on a Mac. Please be aware that forgetting the password you use to encrypt the data means you will no longer be able to access the data. There is no way around this, so proceed with caution.FileVault - Full Drive EncryptionFileVault is the built-in full disk encryption solution offered by Apple. In addition to the security benefits of encryption, FileVault also enables: Needing a password to log in when your Mac is in sleep and after the screen saver; Only users with FileVault enabled can log in. All other users will need an administrator to log in first.    On your Mac, choose Apple menu &gt; System Preferences    Click Security &amp; Privacy    Click FileVault    Click the lock icon to unlock it, then enter an administrator name and password.    Click Turn On FileVault    Choose how to unlock your disk and reset your login password if you forget it:            Use your iCloud account: Click Allow my iCloud account to unlock my disk.        Create a recovery key: Click &quot;Create a recovery key and do not use my iCloud account.&quot; Write down the recovery key and keep it in a safe place. If for some reason you forget your login password, the recovery key may allow you to recover your data.            Click Continue.            If your Mac has additional users, their information is also encrypted. Users unlock the encrypted disk with their login password.        If there&rsquo;s an Enable Users button, you must enter a user&rsquo;s login password before they can unlock the encrypted disk. Click Enable Users, select a user, enter the login password, click OK, then click Continue.

Apple refers to encrypted containers as a secure disk image (.dmg file), which is a file that looks and acts like a mountable device or volume.    In the Disk Utility app on your Mac, choose File &gt; New Image &gt; Blank Image.    Enter a filename for the disk image, add tags if necessary, then choose where to save it. This is the name that appears in the Finder, where you save the disk image file before opening it.    In the Name field, enter the name for the disk image. This is the name that appears on your desktop and in the Finder sidebar, after you open the disk image.    In the Size field, enter a size for the disk image.    Click the Format pop-up menu, then choose a format:            If you're using the encrypted disk image with a Mac computer using macOS 10.13 or later, choose APFS or APFS (Case-sensitive).        If you're using the encrypted disk image with a Mac computer using macOS 10.12 or earlier, choose Mac OS Extended (Journaled) or Mac OS Extended (Case-sensitive, Journaled).            Click the Encryption pop-up menu, then choose an encryption option.    Enter and re-enter a password to unlock the disk image, then click Choose.            WARNING: If you forget this password, you won&rsquo;t be able to open the disk image and view any of the files.            Use the default settings for the rest of the options:            Click the Partitions pop-up menu, then choose Single partition - GUID Partition Map.        Click the Image Format pop-up menu, then choose &ldquo;read/write&rdquo; disk image.            Click Save, then click Done. Disk Utility creates the disk image file where you saved it in the Finder and mounts its disk icon on your desktop and in the Finder sidebar.    In the Finder, copy the documents you want to protect to the disk image.    If you want to erase the original documents so they can&rsquo;t be recovered, drag them to the Trash, then choose Finder &gt; Empty Trash.When not using your secure disk image, be sure to eject the secure disk image. This way, others with access to your computer will not be able to access these files.Important: Be sure to record and keep this password in a safe place. You cannot access the data without this password.The following Apple support article was used to provide the setup steps: https://support.apple.com/guide/disk-utility/create-a-disk-image-dskutl11888/macRemovable Media (e.g., CD/DVDs, USB Drives, and Memory Cards) - Full Drive EncryptionWARNING: When you encrypt a disk or other media, the disk format is converted to the APFS format and then encrypted. Macs with older versions of macOS that don&rsquo;t support the APFS format will not be able to read the device&rsquo;s data.

    "question": "Getting Your PC Unblocked on the UH Network",
    "answer": "The following information pertains only to computers utilizing a Windows-based operating system that have become infected with a virus and that are on the UH Network.Detecting and Removing VirusesVirus infection is a common reason a computer can get blocked from the University of Hawaii network. A virus is defined as a program that was purposely designed to be loaded and run unknowingly on a computer. Some viruses (called worms) replicate themselves and spread to other computers using the network or via infected email messages. Computers are blocked from the network in order to prevent this from happening.Possible 'blocked' computerIf you previously have been able to get on the Internet, haven't made any changes to your computer network system, but find that you are unable to get to a web address using a browser while others in your office are able to do so, there is a possibility that your UH Username or Internet Protocol (IP) address might be blocked from the UH network. You may call the Information Technology Services (ITS) Help Desk at (808) 956-8883 from O'ahu, or (800) 558-2669 from the neighbor islands to check if this could be the case.Virus infected computerIf your computer is acting very sluggish or is randomly experiencing control problems, or if you have received email messages from friends saying that an email you sent them contained a virus, your computer may be infected with a virus. You should run through the following virus removal procedures to ensure that your computer is not a security risk.StingerThe McAfee Stinger program is a stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses found on computers today. Stinger is updated every couple of months to keep up-to-date with the newest viruses. You should always download the latest version. You can obtain an updated version of Stinger along with instructions on how to use the program from https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/downloads/free-tools/stinger.html.If you do not have access to a computer with an Internet connection, you can walk into an ITS Lab and we will download the software for you. Please be sure to bring a USB flash drive.McAfee Anti-virusThe University of Hawaii provides anti-virus software free to active University faculty, staff, or students with a valid UH Username and password. You can download the anti-virus software and instructions online from https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1254.Preventing Future PC InfectionsThis is probably the most important and overlooked step of cleaning a PC. The PC must be secured and patched to prevent future infections. If your PC is not secured you may be re-infected and blocked from using the UH network multiple times. If you have been blocked from using the UH network previously it will be more difficult to get your PC unblocked on successive network blockings.Change/create Passwords for Windows ComputersIt is important to be sure that all of the accounts on your Windows computer have secure passwords. Insecure passwords can be easily guessed or obtained by automated guessing programs. A secure password is at a minimum six to eight characters long with at least one upper, one lower, one number and one special character. See Password Guidelines for tips on creating strong passwords.If your PC is connected to a Windows domain, please contact your system administrator. For more information, see http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-passwordChange your password on Windows 10    Click the Start button, click Settings, click Accounts.    Click Sign-in options    Under Password, Click Change    Enter your current password    Enter your new password twice along with a password hint, then click Next.    Click the Finish button to Change your password.Windows Updates and PatchesWindows updates and patches are important for securing Windows PCs. Your computer may get infected or compromised if the Windows security patches are not up-to-date. To manually check for Windows updates:For Windows 10    Select the Start &nbsp;button, and then go to Settings &nbsp;&gt; Update &amp; security &nbsp;&gt; Windows Update, and select Check for updates.&nbsp;&nbsp;"

    "question": "Security (or lack of it) on the Internet",
    "answer": "The modern age of surfing the internet has produced many ways for unwanted email (spam) to get to you. Some are annoying by sending you unwanted information about a product being sold, but others more recently are highly invasive with potential of identity theft and fraudulent financial scams.SpamAny unsolicited (and usually commercial advertising) email is spam. However, this is very subjective. What might be &quot;spam&quot; to some, might be considered research to another. Spam sent to @hawaii.edu addresses is managed by Google's robust spam filter. Email messages that the filter deems highly likely to be spam will not be delivered to your mailbox and instead placed in the folder labeled &quot;Spam&quot; (or &quot;Gmail/Spam&quot; if using a mail client).&nbsp; More information is available at the Spam at the University of Hawaii article.To minimize the amount of spam that you receive (information taken from the Federal Trade Commission):    Try not to display your email address in public, such as on websites, newsgroups, and your online service's membership directory.    Check the privacy policy when you submit your address to a website.    Read and understand the entire form before you transmit personal information through a website.    Decide if you want to use two email addresses - one for personal messages and the other for newsgroups and chat rooms.    Use an email filter.PhishingPhishing (pronounced &quot;fishing&quot;) is an Internet scam that uses spam or pop-up messages to deceive you into disclosing your credit card numbers, bank account information, Social Security number, passwords, or other sensitive information. The messages appear to be from legitimate organizations such as banks, credit unions, and online shopping sites asking you to verify your personal information. Generally, these messages state that if you do not update or verify your information, your account will be canceled or deleted. The intent will be to use your credit card or financial accounts for their personal purposes, leaving you with the bills and highly time-consuming job of sorting out a bad credit rating.To avoid getting hooked by a phishing scam:NEVER respond to these types of email by clicking on the web link in the email message and entering your personal information, and DON'T reply to the message either.These are the guidelines from the Federal Trade Commission:    If you get an email or pop-up message that asks for personal or financial information, do not reply or click on the link in the message. Legitimate companies don't ask for this information via email.    Don't email personal or financial information.    Review credit card and bank account statements as soon as you receive them.    Use anti-virus software and keep it up to date.    Be cautious about opening any attachment or downloading any files from emails you receive, regardless of who sent them.What to do...If you obtain spam from an @hawaii.edu account, you can report it to uhabuse@hawaii.edu.If it's not from an @hawaii.edu account:    report suspicious activity to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/#/ or 1-877-382-4357.    If you get spam that is phishing for information, forward it to spam@uce.gov.    If you believe you've been scammed, file your complaint at https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/#/, then visit the FTC's Identity Theft Web site at https://www.identitytheft.gov/#/Steps to learn how to minimize your risk of damage from ID theft.    If you receive a porn spam (pornography), you can report it to FTC https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/#/. It should also be reported back to the ISP (Internet Service Provider) where the email originated from.Phishing notificationPlease go to http://www.hawaii.edu/its under the Security Alerts section to check for the latest phishing attacks targeting UH usernames.If you would like to receive phishing notices by email, go to http://www.hawaii.edu/its/notices/index.php and subscribe to our phishing alert email list."

Here are some guidelines (in no particular order) which you may consider:    Departments should make an attempt to produce a website with information about the services offered. People visit a site to find out about what programs are being offered or how to enroll in them, or some other specific and useful information offered at the site. Sites that are simply of the &quot;who we are&quot; variety which just talks about the department or office and contains a staff listing are not as useful.    Include the name of the department responsible for the content at the   bottom.    Include an email address at the bottom of the page for questions or   to report problems.    Include a &quot;Last Reviewed&quot; or a &quot;Last Updated&quot; date   at the bottom. (The term &quot;Last Reviewed&quot; implies that although   the information may not have changed since the last time, it is being checked   for accuracy on a periodic basis.)    Consider accessibility for the disabled. Information on website accessibility can be found at http://hawaii.edu/access/webaccess.html.

    "question": "Tips to Create a Strong and Secure Password",
    "answer": "The days of using simple words, a single character, or a blank password are gone. Today, easy passwords can be cracked or guessed within hours or even minutes. Since the information on your computer is precious and potentially confidential, you need to protect it as much as you can. This guide is to help you create strong and solid passwords that will serve as a roadblock for intruders who are trying to break-in to your computer or online accounts.    Length &ndash; The number of characters for your password is very important. The recommended number of characters are at least eight characters (a UH Username password is required to be 8-32 characters). A three character password such as fgy can easily be guessed by an intruder (or a password cracking program) much more quickly&nbsp; than an eight character password such as 10RvR09$.    &nbsp;    Strength &ndash; The strength of a password refers to the complexity of the password. In other words, can anyone guess what your password is? For example, if your computer account is janedoe and your password is janedoe or JaneDoe, an intruder can easily try and succeed in logging into your computer. You should not use words that can be traced to you such as your address, pet name, spouse name, surname, nickname, and should not use any words contained in dictionaries in any languages.        To strengthen your password, the recommendation is to use a mix of special characters, numbers, and the alphabet (a UH Username password requires one upper case character, one lower case character, one number, and one special character). Special characters are !@#$%^&amp;*()_+{}. Here are a few examples of stronger passwords: uRkn2T@ or R24Real? or Yc@nU95.    &nbsp;    Keywords &ndash; Most people are familiar with creating simple temporary passwords for new employees or for other trusted people with the intent on allowing them to change the password at a later time. Passwords like abc123 and 567fgh were commonly used. If you use or ever used this method, you should break this habit. These passwords are almost like not having a password because intruders have programmed these words into their software to guess your password. The recommended practice is to assign a strong password from the beginning so that the new employee or trusted colleague will also follow your lead.    &nbsp;    Historical &ndash; It is not a good practice to create four or five passwords and switch between them every time the computer reminds you to change your password. It would defeat the purpose of having a life span for the passwords. For example:        start &ndash; my password is Tr*2catchmE!     45 days later&ndash; I change my password to U#can&rsquo;tGetIN%     45 days later &ndash; I change my password to Wht$Up23&amp;     45 days later &ndash; I change my password back to the starting password Tr*2catchmE!        Do not just add on more characters to your existing password such as Tr*2catchmE!456. If the intruder guessed the first part of the password, they would just need to guess the last three characters.        Be creative. You should not recycle passwords! This is one resource that you are allowed to waste.    &nbsp;    One for All &ndash; Avoid re-using passwords across multiple accounts/services. Keeping track of passwords for different accounts can be difficult. It is very convenient to create a strong password and use it for all your accounts for your credit card company website, your home Internet service provider, your work computer, or your personal email accounts like Hotmail or Yahoo. However, this is a bad habit and you should never do this. Let&rsquo;s say that you have 14 accounts with a variety of Web sites or email sites. An intruder breaks into one of those companies who offer these services. The intruder now has your password for all 14 accounts and will have an easy time gaining access to those accounts. The recommended practice is to have unique passwords for each account. This means that you will have 14 different passwords if we use the previous example. This way the intruder will not be able to take over all of your accounts.    &nbsp;    Previously Exposed &ndash; When attempting to gain access to online accounts via brute force, malicious actors use a &quot;dictionary&quot; of compromised passwords that they know have been previously or commonly used. Whenever a data breach occurs for any service, the number of entries in their &quot;dictionary&quot; grows. It is recommended to never use a password that has been previously exposed in a data breach - even if it the password was never associated with your email address or one of your accounts. The website&nbsp;https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords provides an easy way to check whether or not a given password has been previously exposed.Other password-related security tips are:    Do NOT share your passwords with anyone!&nbsp; They *could* easily misuse your account or give your password to someone else.    &nbsp;        If you do login to your account using a public, shared computer (like in a net cafe or public library) change your password later using a safe,secure computer.&nbsp; The public computer may be infected with a keystroke logger that can record your account and password that can be used by spammers and hackers.    &nbsp;        Do NOT post your password on your computer monitor, any where on your desk, under your keyboard, or in other commonly accessible areas.This guide was created to make you aware of the consequences of using weak or blank passwords and not to make cause undue concern or anxiety. Remember that your password is your key into unlocking your computer and it is comparable to a car key unlocking your car door. Creating strong password is one of the easiest security tools to keep your accounts and information safe.Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)For added security, consider enrolling in UH's Multi-Factor Authentication service, Duo. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is an extra layer of protection on top of your UH Username and password. When MFA is enabled, UH Login requires two factors for a successful login. The first factor is what we commonly do today, sign-in with the UH Username and password. The second factor requires authentication through a device (e.g. smartphone or landline) to login. Using these multiple factors provides increased security to your UH account information.MFA can decrease the risk of an account compromise since UH Login would require more than just the UH Username and password for authentication. To enable MFA, simply register a device; you will be prompted for the second factor using the registered device when logging into any service or application using UH Login authentication.MFA is offered, free of charge, to all students, faculty, and staff at the University of Hawai'i. Mobile device service charges may apply.For more information or to register your device, visit&nbsp;https://www.hawaii.edu/its/uhlogin/.For MFA FAQs, visit&nbsp;https://www.hawaii.edu/its/faq-topics/mfa-faq/"

    "question": "Securely Deleting Electronic Information",
    "answer": "In today's digital age, we routinely store personal and sensitive information such as our banking and tax information, addresses and phone numbers, and photos on a variety of magnetic storage media. Traditional media includes computer hard drives, USB flash drives, CD-ROMs, and DVDs. &quot;Lifestyle&quot; devices such as smart phones (iPhones, Samsung Galaxy, etc.), mobile entertainment devices (iPods and MP3 players) are extremely versatile and are also being used to send/receive email and attachments, take/store photos, keep lists of names/addresses/phone numbers &ndash; all of which can be considered personal or sensitive information. Other types of storage are Compact Flash, Memory Stick cards, and Secure Digital (SD) memory cards.To prevent your information from being misused, care should be taken to ensure that any personal or sensitive information is securely deleted especially before recycling or disposing of any such devices or storage media. This document provides an overview on how to securely delete information from commonly used electronic devices. The first section describes methods that can be used for equipment that will be re-used or recycled (given or sold to someone else for further use). The second section describes secure deletion methods that should be used if the equipment is to be permanently disposed of (not re-used).Why &quot;DELETE&quot; is not enough:Using a computer's standard &quot;delete&quot; function is not sufficient to permanently erase sensitive information. When you delete a file or folder using the &quot;Recycle Bin&quot; or &quot;Trash&quot;, your operating system simply flags the contents of the file/folder to be overwritten and re-used in the future. Until that space is overwritten, the contents of the file still exist on the media and can be recovered with disk/file recovery tools that are readily found on the Internet. With today's large hard drives, the contents of these &quot;deleted&quot; files can remain, unchanged, on the media for a very long time.Section 1 &ndash; Equipment will be recycled:To securely erase the information, it must be overwritten. The more times the information is overwritten, the less likely it can be recovered. However, the more times you overwrite the information, the longer the process will take. This process is called &quot;disk wiping&quot; or &quot;disk shredding.&quot; It is recommended that the higher the sensitivity or confidentiality of the information, the more times the information should be overwritten.There are commercial, shareware, and free disk wiping tools. Some tools will allow you to delete individual files or folders and others will erase an entire hard drive. While there are freeware tools that perform well, these may require a more technical understanding of computers to use them properly. Commercial products tend to be easier to use and understand. Please read the instructions thoroughly for the tool that you select. The files/folders you delete will be permanently erased and cannot be recovered. If you are unsure of how to use your selected tool or don't know which tool to use, please seek assistance from a knowledgeable source.If you are recycling a computer or device, securely erasing the entire hard drive is recommended. Be aware that doing so will also erase the operating system requiring a complete re-installation of the operating system before the computer can be used again.Windows OS: Eraser is highly rated free tool for any computer using the Windows operating system. This tool works well to delete individual files and folders that contain sensitive or personal information that you no longer need. Eraser can be downloaded from: https://eraser.heidi.ie/download/&nbsp;To erase an entire hard drive, a recommended free tool is Darik's Boot and Nuke (DBAN): http://dban.sourceforge.net/With this tool, you'll need to create a bootable USB flash drive or CD, then boot your computer. The application will launch automatically and you'll need to specify which partition or hard drive that you'd like erased.You can also see Microsofts article about safetly disposing of computers for more information on data erasure: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/safety/online-privacy/safely-dispose-computers-and-devices.aspxA list of free tools is available at: http://www.thefreecountry.com/security/securedelete.shtmlMacintosh Computers: Mac computer hard drives can be securely erased by zeroing their data. The Apple site provides step-by-step instructions for securely erasing from within macOS using Disk Utility. Note that securely erasing may take a long time, depending on the size of the hard drive.&nbsp;More detailed information for Macs can be found at the following links:        Disk Utility for macOS Sierra: Erase a volume using Disk Utility https://support.apple.com/kb/PH22241            For a general search of the the Apple Knowledge Base, go to: https://support.apple.com.    In previous versions of macOS, you were able to securely delete items in the trash through the &ldquo;Secure Empty Trash&rdquo; command in the Finder to ensure that deleted files were overwritten. This feature has been deprecated in current versions of macOS due to hardware limitations in modern solid state drives (SSD). To limit access deleted items and documents, you may want to encrypt your device. You can find out about more about macOS encryption at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837Section 2: Equipment will be disposed of (destroyed):Degaussing is a permanent method to securely delete information from most magnetic storage devices. Degaussing is a process by which the storage media is subjected to a very powerful magnetic field which demagnetizes the media and renders it permanently unusable. Degaussing is most commonly used with inoperable hard drives and magnetic tapes in large enterprise environments. The price of a low-end degausser starts at approximately $3000. Working hard drives in computers should be erased with a tool such as the above mentioned DBAN before disposing of the computer. However, most modern computers use solid state drives (SSDs) and do not rely on magnetic plates to store data. For these types of drives, degaussing would not erase the data within them. The most effective way to erase data from SSDs would be to reformat them or physically destroy them.Physical Destruction: Commercial services are available to physically shred hard disks. Tapes can be unwound from the spools. The magnetic media can then be physically cut into pieces such as running it through a shredder. The same types of services are also available for solid state drives: they can be crushed and shredded.Write-Once Media (CDs. DVDs):CDs and DVDs that can only be written to once (also called CD-R, or DVD-R), must be physically destroyed preferably by running it through paper shredders that are also rated for shredding CDs and credit cards.Cell Phones:For information on how to delete all your information from your cell phone before recycling or disposing of it, check with your cell phone manufacturer.&nbsp;"

    "question": "Frequently Asked Questions About Adding Information to UHINFO",
    "answer": "Information on the Web becomes part of UHINFO when it's stored or linked into the central information servers on campus. Many colleges, schools, and departments run servers and the Information Technology Services (ITS) office also maintains several central information servers for departments who do not maintain their own servers.Please Note: Due to security reasons, we are only allocating space  on our Web server to University departments. Exceptions may be made to  Registered Independent Organizations (RIOs) if they have special  programming needs. Otherwise, we encourage RIOs to use the free Web  space allocated with their ITS Usernames for their Web page. RIOs may  download an ITS Username Request form here: www.hawaii.edu/help/accounts/deptaccts.html. Space will not be allocated to any organizations outside of the  University.Also note that departmental Web sites on UHINFO must meet the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) guidelines for accessibility for people with disabilities. Please see Assistive Technology and Accessibility for People with DisabilitiesQuestions    When should our department consider putting a document or database on the central UHINFO servers?    When should our department consider putting information on a local (departmental) server?    We want to create a server for our department, where can we get advice?    We want to create and maintain a departmental Web page, but not run our own server. Can we do that?    Our campus organization/student group already has a server, how can it be added to the server list?    How do I get more information about putting data (but not maintaining our own Web pages) on the central UHINFO servers?Answers1. When should our department or organization consider putting a document or database on the central UHINFO servers?You may consider putting up information on these servers when:    Information is so popular that the number of people consulting it might overwhelm your local network; or    Information is so critical to campus functions that it needs to be reliably available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week; or    Information is of interest to the whole campus, but the department doesn't have a network or any way to support a server.2. When should our department consider putting information on a local (departmental) server?This option may be better for your department if:    The department wants its own special hostname (e.g., www.history.hawaii.edu).    The department wants a lot of local control over the look and feel of the information, and values the flexibility and convenience of managing updates directly; or    Information is of primary interest to the department; or    Information is of wide interest, but the number of people consulting it can be handled by the local network and server; or    The department has a lot of information and wants to create a Web structure to tie it all together; and    The department has its own personnel available to maintain the server.3. We want to create a server for our department, where can we get advice?There is an ever increasing number of books, courses, and online resources that are available to help you get started. For smaller Web sites, a simple Windows or Macintosh computer will be adequate.&nbsp;4. We want to create and maintain a departmental Web page, but not run  our own server. Can we do that?Here are some options:    (preferred) Department faculty or staff who are willing to maintain their department's information may request space on the ITS server. Please see How to Get your Information into UHINFO for the necessary information.    You can create your own pages in your home directory on uhunix following the same instructions for creating personal home pages.    You can request a departmental uhunix ID from the Help Desk, then create your own pages in this home directory by following the same instructions for creating personal home pages.If you need help in writing HTML, there is a small sampling of the online resources to assist in Web creation linked to UHINFO.Perhaps the best advice would be to go out and explore other servers to find out which features you like and dislike before working on your own pages.Once you have some of that set up, you may want to contact webhead@hawaii.edu to discuss other viable options like putting it up on a different server.&nbsp;5. Our campus organization/student group already has a server, how can it be added to the server list?Send an email message to webhead@hawaii.edu with such details as the:    the server's Uniform Resource Locator (URL)    a short description of your organization's server    what department or organization is  responsible  for  maintaining the server, and    email address for the server's administrator6. How do I get more information about putting data (but not maintaining our own Web pages) on the central UHINFO servers?There are several ways to submit information to UHINFO:    For one time events, go to the UH Events Calendar and click on the &quot;Add an Event&quot; button at the bottom.    For on-going information, send an email message to webhead@hawaii.edu who will be happy to discuss it in more detail."

    "question": "Getting Started with Departmental Pages",
    "answer": "As a UH Department, your staff can have access to the Information Technology Services (ITS) Web servers for putting departmental information online.Getting SpaceThe recommended method for doing this is to have someone in the department who is already familiar with creating Web pages to be authorized to log into the ITS Web server and upload your department's pages into a specific directory. In brief, here are the steps to take:    You can request your department website at https://www.hawaii.edu/its/webservice/front.php    Have the name and UH Username of the person who will be responsible for uploading/maintaining your department's data    Think of a name for your department's directory that will be created. It should be short and concise; the URL will be of the form &lt;campus&gt;.hawaii.edu/directoryname/ so the shorter the better. Examples of these might be manoa.hawaii.edu/ar/ for Admissions and Records and manoa.hawaii.edu/its/ for Information Technology Services.    This request must come from UH faculty or staff; students may not request space for a department.    Note: If you require more than one person to maintain the department's pages, you may provide up to three Usernames.Please Note: Due to security reasons, we are only allocating space on our Web server to University departments. Exceptions may be made to Registered Independent Organizations (RIOs) if they have special programming needs. Otherwise, we encourage RIOs to use the free Web space allocated with their ITS Usernames for their webpage. RIOs may request an Organizational UH Username. Space will not be allocated to any organizations outside of the University.Creating Your PagesThere are tons of ways to create your pages. You can learn HTML by taking a beginner's class (check with the Outreach College), getting a book, or by purchasing software (go to the UH Bookstore). We recommend obtaining an HTML Editor software program for your computer such as Macromedia Dreamweaver by Adobe. HTML Editors work like basic word processing programs that can save your work as an HTML page suitable for the Web.Uploading Your Pages to the ITS Web ServerThe last thing to do is to upload your files to the ITS Web server so they will be available on the Internet for all to see.You can use any free &quot;SFTP&quot; software to upload your website files. You can obtain free SSH software. You can also download these off the Internet or from other sources. Check with the ITS Help Desk for more information.You will need to know the correct login ID and password, which directory you will put your information into, and the hostname of the computer you'll connect to. The webmaster will provide this information to you upon approval of your request for Web space.TIPSA few tips that might be useful:    A more useful website is not a &quot;who we are&quot; kind of site, but rather one that contains information that is really useful to the audience, like the kinds of programs or courses offered; descriptions of events that are being sponsored; tips on studying; instructions for getting into a program; and so forth.    If you feel uncomfortable with the technology, it might make sense to hire a good student assistant who can be responsible for your department's website (under your supervision, of course). Most students nowadays are very computer literate and have seen a lot of webpages to have some idea of what can be done. With the proper tools and some guidance, the student can often do a fantastic job."

    "question": "Browser Recommendations for ITS-Supported Web Applications",
    "answer": "Browser RecommendationsThe following browser recommendations are for ITS-supported web applications and are based on coordinated testing efforts between the ITS Help Desk and the developers for various ITS-supported web applications. Because of the rapid changes to modern web browsers, please check the matrices of test results for Windows browsers and Mac OS browsers frequently, as browser test results will be posted as soon as they are available.Windows Browser MatrixmacOS Browser MatrixMicrosoft EdgeMicrosoft Edge is included with Windows 10 and higher, and it can be updated via Windows Updates. ITS supports the versions included with the currently supported Windows versions.    Windows OS Information    Microsoft EdgeSafariSafari is included with macOS and can be updated through the Mac App Store. ITS supports the versions included with the currently supported macOS versions.    macOS Information    Updating SafariChromeThe latest version of Google Chrome and the version immediately preceding it are supported by ITS. See Chrome Releases blog for details on the current version.Chrome 45 and later does not support NPAPI plugins, such as Java, Silverlight, and Flash.    System Requirements    Download Latest Version    Updating Google ChromeFirefoxITS supports the latest version of Firefox and the version immediately preceding it. Additionally, support is provided for the latest ESR release.As of version 52 and later, Firefox does not support NPAPI plugins such as Java and Silverlight.    System Requirements (Latest Release)    System Requirements (ESR)    Download Latest Release    Download Latest ESR    Updating FirefoxFactors for RecommendationsWhile individual users and departments may have specific browser preferences, the recommendations are based on many factors:    Testing         Recommendations are the result of extensive testing, when possible, and reflect what works best for each application. ITS does not favor a particular browser and recommends what provides the best user experience.         Manufacturer support         Some applications are purchased externally, so recommendations and requirements come directly from the manufacturer. For example, the Peoplesoft and Banner systems have specific browser recommendations that are not set by ITS.         Operating System         Operating systems may come with a specific browser version pre-installed and recommendations will not go backwards to lower versions. For example, Windows 7 comes with IE 8, so recommendations are for that version or higher. Note also that browsers can run differently under various operating systems. Thus, recommendations vary depending on the OS.         Range and number of users.         The ITS Help Desk provides support to all University users. With the broad range and large number of users across the system, it is necessary at some point to discontinue support for older/out-dated browser versions and stay up-to-date with newer releases.         Consistency         The ITS Help Desk also provides support for many applications across the system and every application, whether developed in-house or purchased externally, has unique requirements. The recommendations aim to provide consistency for users such that upgrading does not adversely affect the use of other applications. Therefore, recommendations are not always for the most current browser versions and ITS may not be able to provide definitive recommendations for current versions until full testing across applications is complete. The matrices will indicate when partial, but not comprehensive, testing has been done for a browser version to provide the best available results at any given time.          Helpful Tips            Upgrading             Before upgrading your operating system or browser, consult with the ITS Help Desk to verify that upgrading will not adversely affect the applications you use.             Version numbers             Browser versions can be very specific. Version numbers reflect changes to the browser's code, either because new features have been added or updates have been included to fix previous bugs. If you experience problems, make sure you are running a version that is properly supported.             Use what works             The recommendations provided are what the ITS Help Desk currently supports and has tested. In some cases, applications may work using versions not listed in the browser matrices. However, if you experience problems with versions not listed in the browser matrices, the Help Desk will encourage the use of supported and tested browser versions."

    "question": "Personal Home Page Policies",
    "answer": "The server that the UH Personal Home Pages resides on is administered by Information Technology Services (ITS) and is intended to allow faculty, staff, and students space to create personal home pages. We wish to retain the ability to publish pages for our users and we intend to do so by informing our users of the basic policies and by obtaining their cooperation.Below are some of the more prominent points to remember regarding the computing policies:Responsibility for ContentThe content of all the UH Personal Home Pages is solely the responsibility of the individual authors; UH Information Technology Services (ITS), the University of Hawaii (UH), and the State of Hawaii are not responsible for its content. ITS will not monitor content except if it becomes necessary to investigate complaints or allegations that such content violates federal, state, or local laws or University of Hawaii policies.ITS, UH, and the State of Hawaii are also not responsible for the content of every page accessible from the UH Personal Home Pages (i.e., external links).All policies which apply to the university's computing and network resources (including the Executive Policy Use and Management of Information Technology Resources and the Student Conduct Code) apply to the UH Personal Home Pages. These shall include the following:    No illegal material (which may include sexually explicit/offensive images or sounds, and copyrighted or licensed material)    No pages created for commercial purposes    No deliberate acts which waste computing resources or which unfairly monopolize resources to the exclusion of othersAny violation of these policies may result in the incident being brought before the Dean of Students and/or University of Hawaii legal entities for disciplinary action.&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriate ContentDue to inherent limitations of the the Personal Home Pages (20MB storage space limit, lack of content support, no non-HTML language support), we recommend that Perosnal Home Pages be used for personal purposes. However, a user may host academic class materials or other materials/information for academic purposes if they wish. A faculty or staff member who requires functionality beyond the scope of what the Personal Home Pages offers should use departmental web space and not the Personal Home Page service. Faculty and staff should contact their departmental IT Specialist for web space on their official college/department Web server.Mr/Ms (Over) PopularityBecause the UH Personal Home Pages is a shared resource, it is an inappropriate place to offer any service (whether it be commercial or otherwise) that is likely to attract a large volume of network traffic from the Internet. ITS may investigate any pages that are generating an abnormal amount of traffic.Creating Personal HomepagesTo get started, or for more information on how to create your own personal homepage, please visit the following article:&nbsp;Creating Personal Homepages.&nbsp;"

    "question": "Disposal Guidelines For Unused UH-Owned Computer Equipment",
    "answer": "This document is intended to assist University of Hawai&lsquo;i departments who wish to dispose of computer equipment that may still be useful to others. These guidelines are not intended to replace any Administrative Procedures, so be sure to consult with your Administrative Officer (AO) or Fiscal Officer (FO) for specific procedures to facilitate the disposal.Before initiating any disposal effort, you must verify ownership using the state decal number (or serial number if no decal is found) against the departmental inventory records. If the item cannot be found on the inventory records, it may be necessary for your AO or FO to research the original purchase before the disposal process can begin.PROTECT YOUR INFORMATIONBefore donating or recycling a computer you should erase all files containing personal information. Simply deleting files isn&rsquo;t enough; you should overwrite the disc files. UH Information Technology Services (ITS) has compiled tips for &ldquo;Securely Deleting Electronic Information.&rdquo;DISPOSAL OF UH-OWNED EQUIPMENT BY TRANSFERThe preferred method of disposing of computer equipment is to find another University department, state department, or agency that can use the equipment.    First, send out email or internal memos to see if there is anyone within your department or college that would want the equipment.        If no one within your unit is interested, advertise the item on the UH Electronic Swap Meet.    Before adding your notice, be sure to search the current database of available or wanted items to see if anyone has already posted a request for a similar item. (You may also click the button on the right side of the main page to be added to an email list that will notify you when new items are added to the Swap Meet database.)        Contact the State of Hawaii Surplus Property Branch at (808) 831-6757, or other state departments or agencies you know of that may have use for the equipment.If another University unit agrees to the equipment, have your department Administrative Officer (AO) or Fiscal Officer (FO) process in KFS (Kuali Financial Systems).DISPOSAL OF UH-OWNED EQUIPMENT BY DONATIONIf there is no department interested in your surplus equipment, the organizations listed below will accept used computers and peripherals to be placed in schools or other non-profit areas. While newer, working equipment is preferred, older or non-working pieces may also be accepted. In all cases, notify your AO or FO prior to finalizing your donation.While we have made a best effort to provide a comprehensive list that includes current contact information please contact ITS if you encounter an outdated link or have additional options to share.

This is done to preserve the University of Hawaii's &quot;safe harbor&quot; status as provided in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. The infringing user will be required to meet with a University official before being unblocked and allowed back on to the University's network.If the infringing user is identified, AND IT IS THEIR FIRST OFFENSE, he/she will be informed that:    unauthorized downloading and distribution of copyrighted materials is illegal and in violation of UH policy    all unauthorized copies of any copyrighted materials must be removed immediately        any subsequent violations of E2.210 and/or federal copyright laws will be result in the incident being referred to the appropriate University judiciary authority for further actionIf the user is a UH faculty or staff member, their department is notified.&nbsp; If the user is a student in the residence halls, ResNet administrators are notified.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any user found to be participating in copyright infringement activities will be notified that such activities are illegal and in violation of UH Executive Policy E2.210: Use and Management of Information Technology Resources and the user will be required to digitally sign a Copyright Notification Letter.

    "question": "The UH VPN Service",
    "answer": "VPN stands for &quot;Virtual Private Network&quot;.&nbsp; It enables IP traffic to travel securely over a public TCP/IP network by encrypting all traffic from one network to another. VPNs are generally used when a person wants to use a computer from a remote site (such as their home) to access &quot;enterprise&quot; (corporate) resources. The UH VPN allows you to become part of the UH network from anywhere.Why should I use the UH VPN?Access to the UH VPN is only necessary if it is required by a specific institutional application (such as PeopleSoft or STAR). Check with your application administrator if you require access to the application from a non-UH network.&nbsp; They will tell you if you need to use the UH VPN. &nbsp; Most general applications (UH email, Laulima, etc.) should be accessible without having to use the UH VPN.How do I get access?You will need:1)&nbsp; Your UH Username and password (and you must be currently affiliated with UH)2)&nbsp; A Windows, Macintosh, iOS, or Android device that is connected to a network and configured to use the UH VPNSpecific details on using the UH VPN can be found at:&nbsp; http://www.hawaii.edu/its/vpn/Please note that use of the VPN requires some knowledge of configuring the network settings of your computer."

    "question": "Using LDAP with Email Clients",
    "answer": "ITS has a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server available for use by the UH community.&nbsp; For faculty and staff directory listings, a public search of the ITS LDAP directory from your email client might be useful when you need to send a message and you know the person's name, but not their email address.&nbsp; [Note: due to privacy issues, no students are included in the LDAP server.]LDAP works better in some email clients than others.&nbsp; At the time this article was written, LDAP seems to work best in Thunderbird (PC and Macintosh), or Mac Mail. Please note that the more information you provide in the search fields the better and faster your results will be. However, we do not recommend searching by anything other than first name, last name, both first and last, or username. If your search comes up empty try searching a different way.The following are instructions on setting up the ITS supported email clients to use the UH LDAP.Thunderbird 2.0 and higher (Windows and Macintosh)Setup &nbsp;    Go to the Tools menu and select Account Settings.

    "question": "If you suspect that your account has been compromised...",
    "answer": "With the recent increase of phishing scams and a few instances of people replying to these scams, please follow these basic instructions to secure your UH Username. Call our ITS Help Desk to report the possible compromise and to get further assistance.Signs that your UH Username and password were compromised:    Flood of email in your Inbox either in response to spam sent from your account (several thousands of emails) or from people informing you that your account is being compromised    Can't login any more (your account might have been disabled or your password reset)    Suspicious logins are detected for your Google@UH accounts; see http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1587 to check for suspect loginsWhat to do if your account is compromised:        Change your password IMMEDIATELY                    Change your password by going to http://www.hawaii.edu/username and clicking on the Forgot your password? link. More details, including password requirements, can be found at http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/287.        Note: If you receive an error when trying to change your password, it is possible your UH Username has been disabled to prevent malicious use. In this case, please contact the ITS Help Desk for further assistance.                DO NOT use the same password that was previously set. Using a COMPLETELY NEW, unique password not used on any other account or website will decrease the likelihood of another compromise. For example, an 8-character password needs all 8 characters to be changed. Changing only a few characters, or changing only lowercase to uppercase (and the reverse) is not sufficient.                Sign out of all other active sessions (logins) to your Google@UH Gmail            Log into Google@UH Gmail &lt;http://gmail.hawaii.edu&gt;.        Scroll down to the bottom of any page.

Click on gear icon in the upper right, then select Settings.        Check your vacation responder and signature settings for any text not entered by you.        Click on the Accounts tab, and check if your display name has changed or if any additional email addresses have been added.        Click on the Forwarding and POP/IMAP tab and check that there is no unknown forwarding email addresses setup.        Click on the Filters tab, and check that there are no unknown filters that have been added.                Check your computer system for viruses or malware            Check if your operating system has the most recent updates. Run Windows Update on PCs or Software Updates on Macs.        Check if you have the latest anti-virus software version and updates, as well as the latest virus definitions.        Run a scan with your anti-virus software.

To prevent having your UH Username compromised:        NEVER send your password to ANYONE via email    No legitimate institution or organization will ask you to send your password or other confidential information via an email message.            DO NOT REPLY to any suspect email messages    If you see a Reply To: address that is not with our hawaii.edu domain, most likely it is a scam, so please do not reply. Replying to one of these email messages can potentially lead to an increase in these suspect email messages being sent to your email account.    We realize that the instigators of these scams get paid for this and will try all types of methods to get someone to reply. As they get more sophisticated, it can get more difficult to determine if the email is legitimate or not. If in doubt, for any email asking for account information appearing to be from the University of Hawaii, please contact the ITS Help Desk        Make sure your operating system has the most recent updates. Run Windows Update on PCs or Software Updates on Macs.    Make sure you have the latest anti-virus software version and updates, as well as the latest virus definitions.    Review our Securing your Desktop Computer article.    Don't save your UH Username password on your computer. It might take a few extra seconds to login, but it might save you hours of time cleaning up after a compromise.To report a suspicious email saying it's from the University of Hawaii and asking for confidential information:        Forward a copy of the message with full mail headers to phishing@hawaii.edu         [instructions on getting full mail headers can be found at http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/895]        Optional: see if it's already been reported by checking http://www.hawaii.edu/its under &quot;Security Alerts&quot;Additional Information:    Spam at the University of Hawaii    IT Security at UH&nbsp;"

    "question": "Why does the message count in Google@UH Gmail differ from my IMAP email client?",
    "answer": "Gmail counts the number of conversations which are in a mailbox. This differs from most IMAP email clients, which would count the actual messages that are present in a mailbox. So, if some of the email messages are grouped into conversations in Gmail, the message count reported by Gmail will be different than the message count you see through your IMAP email client."

    "question": "Secure Web Browsing",
    "answer": "Many web sites that require sensitive, personal information to be transmitted (e.g. UH sites that require UH Username and password, banking and credit card sites, etc.) are setup with security in place to protect your data. However, this security only protects the data transferred between your web browser and that site. Many web browsers, in an effort to speed up web page load times, will temporarily store web page information (in a cache). Browsers may also store usernames and passwords to sites for your convenience. This stored information may not be deleted by your web browser for a while (depending on your browser's setup) and poses a potential security risk to sensitive information.Private BrowsingDifferent browsers have a &quot;private browsing&quot; mode which prevents the browser from temporarily storing any data once the browser is closed. This alleviates any concern about sensitive information being put at risk.

    "question": "PC Energy Savings Guideline",
    "answer": "UH has over 10,000 networked personal computers to support teaching, research and administration. PCs and other electronic office equipment, such as printers and scanners, collectively consume significant amounts of energy. Fortunately, there are ways that personal computers users can conserve energy and save money, without major impact to operations.A desktop personal computer with LCD monitor uses about 1080 kWh per year if left on 24/7 and would cost UH $225* to run. (*Energy rates are expected to increase.) Turning off the computer when you leave for the day, would save about 65%. UH could save $1.57 million a year in energy costs (based on 10,000 units at $0.23 per kWh). Energy estimates depend on computer specifications, duration of use, as well as type of use.

They waste energy and do not save the screen. A screen saver requires that the PC and monitor be at full power. Some graphics-intensive screen savers may burn twice as much energy. Screen savers may prevent the computer from entering sleep mode. You only save energy if the monitor goes dark by going to sleep. Modern CRT and LCD screens are not prone to &quot;burn in&quot; from phosphor burn as older monitors.    For desktop computers, use LCDs instead of CRT monitors.LCDs use less energy (30-35 watts) than CRT monitors (80 watts).    Use a laptop computer, if possible. They are more energy-efficient than desktop computers.A desktop computer when idle uses an average of 89 watts. A laptop when idle uses 15-25 watts. (Dell on Dell: Energy Efficiency)Please consider your work requirements and budget when purchasing computers. Laptops cost more, have less expansion/upgrade options, and are more prone to theft/security issues than desktop computers.    Purchase Energy Star-rated computers when possible. Energy Star is a joint program of the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy to help us save money and protect the environment through energy efficient products and practices. From July 20, 2007, Energy Star's new specifications for computers went into effect. Only the most energy-efficient computers will qualify for the Energy Star label.&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=find_a_product.showProductGroup&amp;pgw_code=COFAQ(adapted from http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=power_mgt.pr_power_mgt_faq)&nbsp;1. Why should I use power management features?You can save up to $75 or more per computer by activating system standby or sleep mode features. You save energy, reduce carbon dioxide emissions and help prevent global warming.2. My screen saver is activated. Do I need to activate power management features?If you want to use your screen saver in conjunction with monitor power management, set the screen saver &quot;wait time&quot; to less than the period of time after which the monitor enters sleep mode. If your screen saver appears but your monitor never enters sleep mode, your screen saver may be the culprit: try disabling it.3. Do computers and monitors use more energy with power management features activated due to power surges when cycling on and off?In reality, the small surge of power created when some devices are turned on is vastly smaller than the energy used by running the device when it is not needed.4. Can sleep features wear out hardware by forcing the computer to turn on and off several times a day?&quot;Modern computers are designed to handle 40,000 on-off cycles before failure, and you're not likely to approach that number during the average computer's five- to seven-year life span. In fact, IBM and Hewlett Packard encourage their own employees to turn off idle computers, and some studies indicate it would require on-off cycling every five minutes to harm a hard drive.&quot;&nbsp;Technical Considerations    Your computer will not go to sleep mode if programs are running in the background.        If your computer is too old (&gt; 5 years old), it may not have power management capabilities.        If you run special applications which require the computer not to be in sleep mode, please do NOT turn on power management for the hard drive.

    "question": "Best Practices for Laptop Users",
    "answer": "Laptop computers are smaller, lighter, and more competitively priced than ever before.&nbsp; More people are selecting laptops as their primary computer enabling them to be more mobile using wireless networks wherever they happen to be.&nbsp; While all users of computers should practice &quot;safe computing&quot;, laptop users should be especially vigilant.&nbsp; Laptops are small and easy to steal - making them convenient targets for thieves.&nbsp; And because access to information (including personal/financial information) is conveniently available through the Internet, most people will access their various accounts using public wireless networks such as hotel &amp; coffee shop networks.&nbsp; You should assume that anyone can see anything on the wireless network.&nbsp; Therefore, when accessing your financial institution's website (or other personal information), ensure that you have a secure web connection by looking for the locked lock icon in your browser.&nbsp;Listed below are some tips to follow when using and traveling with laptops:    Ensure that your laptop has all system and application security patches installed. (Securing Your Computer)    Backup your laptop frequently.    Physically secure the laptop with physical locking devices, especially if access to the laptop is relatively open.    Do not leave the laptop unattended, even if only for a few minutes.&nbsp;    Do not leave laptops in cars including car trunks.    When traveling, do not leave the laptop in plain sight when not in your room.&nbsp; Secure the laptop in an in-room safe if available.    Ensure that the laptop has strong passwords for all usernames.    Configure your laptop to prompt for a password when it's powered on or waking from sleep/hibernation.    If at all possible, DO NOT store sensitive information on the laptop.    If absolutely necessary to keep sensitive information on the laptop, ensure that the information is encrypted. (PC encryption, Mac encryption)    If using a public wireless network (hotel, internet cafe, airport wireless network) to access sensitive information, ensure that your traffic is encrypted.&nbsp; Make sure that the website you are using is a secured website (look for the lock on your browser) or use the UH VPN.&nbsp;Additional tips on safeguarding your laptop can be found at:&nbsp;    FTC - Laptop Security    http://labmice.techtarget.com/articles/laptopsecurity.htm        Keep Your Computer Secure At Home&nbsp;"

    "question": "Online Services for 'Ohana",
    "answer": "&lsquo;Ohana is Hawaiian for &quot;extended family&quot; and is very inclusive. At the University of Hawaii, &lsquo;Ohana refers to the group of individuals consisting of alumni, former faculty or staff, and former University department affiliates who were assigned a UH Username but no longer have an active affiliation with the University. The initial services available for &lsquo;Ohana include:    Password Administration -- Password administration includes management of your secret questions and answer. You can fall back on these if they are wisely chosen to allow you to recover from losing/forgetting your password.    Google@UH Services (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Sites, Groups) -- You can continue to access Google@UH, even after your active association with the University has ended. This includes the continued availability of all data stored in Google@UH services, such as email messages and folders in Google@UH Gmail, data in Google@UH Drive, and sites in Google@UH Sites. POP and IMAP access to Google@UH Gmail will also continue.    STAR -- The University STAR academic advising service allows most alumni to create information transcripts. Note that for official transcripts you still must contact the Registrar's Office.    SECE (only for students who earned a degree from UH) -- The Student Employment website now lists full-time jobs, which are available to recent UH graduates.    MyUH --&nbsp;This academic portal contains links to many UH online services.&lsquo;Ohana enrollment must be renewed annually. You will be sent a series of email reminders in advance of the annual renewal date. Regretfully, should you not renew on time, we will be unable to reestablish your 'Ohana credentials (username and password) and associated services. Any data associated with your UH Username that you manage/maintain yourself, including email, contacts, documents, and websites, will no longer be available.Furthermore, 'Ohana users who exceed their 7.5GB Google@UH quota may have their UH Usernames disabled. This will result in the loss of access to associated online services for 'Ohana and the loss of all data stored within their Google@UH account (including emails stored in Gmail, documents stored in Drive, calendar and contact data, etc.). See&nbsp;https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1891&nbsp;for more information on the Google@UH storage policy for 'Ohana and for help with managing your storage.Individuals are reminded that the use of UH Usernames, and available services accessed through UH Usernames, as &lsquo;Ohana continues to be governed by applicable UH policies and State laws, including UH Executive Policy E2.210 and Chapter 708, Hawaii Revised Statutes.ResourcesEnrolling in &lsquo;Ohana online services http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1137'Ohana Google@UH Storage Policy and Quotas: https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1891Password Administration: http://www.hawaii.edu/usernameSaving Email and Personal Webpages (Mac OS X): http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/977Saving Email and Personal Webpages (Windows): http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/978STAR: https://www.star.hawaii.edu/SECE: http://sece.its.hawaii.edu/seceMyUH: http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1659"

    "question": "The UH Identity Management System",
    "answer": "The University of Hawai'i Identity Management System (UHIMS) collects and consolidates information concerning people associated with the University so that UH may better establish and manage a single, permanent identity for each person. This unique identity enables a person to access all of the appropriate online resources centrally hosted by the University.Middleware is considered to be software glue that enables disparate administrative applications, such as Banner and PeopleSoft, to work together. UHIMS is middleware. It provides UH the ability to automatically enable and disable access to online resources, such as email, Laulima, eCafe, lab computers, and administrative and student online resources, such as MyUH.One of the early accomplishments of UHIMS was to establish the UH Number as a replacement for the Social Security Number (SSN) in order to better protect our community members from identity theft; it is no longer appropriate to use the SSN as a unique identifier. The UH Number has been called &quot;employee ID number&quot; and &quot;student ID number&quot;. Whether a person is a student, faculty, staff, affiliate, ohana, retiree, or some combination of these, a person's UH Number remains the same. Closely associated with the UH Number is a UH Username. The UH Username is used to establish your email address, and, along with a unique password of your choice, it will be your key to using the University's online resources.As a member of the UH community, one sometimes traverses many roles (student, faculty, staff, affiliate, retiree, ohana) and, at times, is in multiple roles at once. UHIMS tracks a person's roles to help ensure that each person has access to the appropriate online resources and services. Additionally, UHIMS provides each person with email updates of role changes that might impact one's access to services, listing in the UH Online Directory, etc.UHIMS implements the following policies as of 2023:    Students, Faculty, Staff, Retirees and Emeriti, by default, have access to basic online services (see Resources below for links to more information).    Retirees and Emeriti retain basic online services by subscription; they will receive annual email messages reminding them to confirm renewal for another year.    Students and pre-students who do not register for classes, and Faculty and Staff that leave employment at UH (retiring is not quite the same thing) automatically transition to a UHIMS role of 'Ohana and, by default, are granted a 180-day grace period during which continued access to email and other basic online services is provided. During the grace period, the option to enroll in our 'Ohana online services is provided. See Resources below for more information on Online Services for 'Ohana.    The option to enroll in our 'Ohana online services is available to users prior to losing their active affiliation and during their grace period. Enrollment is retained by annual renewal; reminders to renew will be sent by email.    The grace period is provided so that data, files, etc. can be archived by the owner and relocated (see Resources below for a link to instructions on saving mail and webpage data to your computer). At the end of the grace period for ohana, all files are deleted from UH servers, which includes personal webpages. Enrollment in our 'Ohana online services will preserve access to the UH email account and all mail data stored there.    For 'Ohana that do not renew their annual enrollment in our 'Ohana online services, all Google@UH data (including emails stored in Gmail, documents stored in Drive, calendar and contact data, etc.)&nbsp;is removed and access to log in with their UH Username and password is revoked.    Beginning on 1/29/2024, 'Ohana users are provided with 7.5 GB of storage quota for their Google@UH account. Users will have the entire length of their grace period (180 days) in order to review their storage usage and download/export/delete emails, files, and photos to bring their usage under their 7.5 GB quota. 'Ohana users who exceed their quota may have their UH Usernames disabled. This will result in the loss of access to associated services and the loss of all data stored within their Google@UH account (including emails stored in Gmail, documents stored in Drive, calendar and contact data, etc.). See Resources below for more information on 'Ohana Google@UH storage limitations and quotas.    For retirees that do not renew their annual subscription for UH basic online services, all Google@UH data (including emails stored in Gmail, documents stored in Drive, calendar and contact data, etc.)&nbsp;is removed, including personal webpages.    For emeriti that do not renew their annual subscription upon expiration, all Google@UH data (including emails stored in Gmail, documents stored in Drive, calendar and contact data, etc.)&nbsp;is removed, including personal webpages. Exclusive to Emeriti, there is an option to request that personal webpages continue to be preserved for as long as possible for the benefit of the larger academic community. While ITS makes no promises, the content will be left intact and accessible for as long as possible. The department of the faculty member continues to have the option to request that the pages be taken down.

    "question": "Phishing at UH",
    "answer": "What is phishing (pronounced &quot;fishing&quot;)?From Wikipedia: phishing is &quot;the criminally fraudulent process of attempting to acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords and credit card details by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication.&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhishingPhishing is usually implemented via email or instant messaging but any electronic messaging system may be used, e.g. Twitter. Phishing emails are usually spammed (sent via bulk, unsolicited email) or could be targeted to a specific organization or group. After obtaining usernames and passwords, cyber criminals could impersonate the owner of the compromised account, steal confidential information, commit identity theft, send more spam, and commit other criminal activities.If you receive phishing email (which may look authentic and legitimate) requesting sensitive information (e.g. usernames, passwords, email addresses, bank account numbers, credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, date of birth, etc.):    DO NOT REPLY to the email. Replying (even to tell the spammer to stop) tells the spammer that your email address is valid.    DO NOT PROVIDE any sensitive information, especially if the email is unsolicited or from an unknown user.    DO NOT CLICK on any links/images/attachments contained in the phishing email. Do NOT enter personal sensitive information into online forms. Malware may also be downloaded and installed on your computer.    IF IN DOUBT, CHECK IT OUT!            CALL the sender/agency/organization to verify that the email is legitimate.        Contact the ITS Help Desk if you have questions about the validity of an official-looking communication.        After a targeted phishing email is reported, Information Technology Services (ITS) may choose to implement protective measures such as:    investigating new phishing attempts    blocking the email address from sending to UH    blocking the reply email address from receiving from UH    contacting users who replied to the phishing email before it was reported and blocked    blocking access to suspicious websites that are linked within the phishing email    posting new phishing email on the Security Alerts website at http://www.hawaii.edu/itsPhishing notificationPlease go to http://www.hawaii.edu/its under the Security Alerts section to check for the latest phishing attacks targeting UH usernames.If you would like to receive phishing notices by email, go to http://www.hawaii.edu/its/notices/index.php and subscribe to our phishing-alert email list.General guidelines for reporting spam/phishing    Google@UH users --&gt; you can report spam or phishing emails directly to Google            To report phishing attempts to Google, follow the instructions at:         http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=184963        To report spam to Google, follow the instructions at:         http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=190737            Targeting UH usernames --&gt; send to phishing@hawaii.edu with full mail headers            &nbsp; See http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/895 for displaying full mail headers.        &nbsp; See http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/898 for reporting a new/suspicious email targeting UH usernames.

Make sure you have a valid UH Username and password.    Check that a valid Network Name (SSID) is being used (see Network Connectivity Matrix above).    Check for adequate signal strength for the SSID. If your signal strength is moderate or low, try moving to a different location where the signal strength is good or excellent. If you are on the UH Manoa Campus, please check the UH Manoa wireless map to make sure the UHM wireless network is available in the area where you are trying to connect.    In your device's network settings, check to see if your wireless connection is bridged with another connection. Remove the bridge if necessary.    If using a computer or laptop, you could try to remove the existing wireless adapter and reinstall them. Also check for updated drivers for your wireless adapter at the manufacturer's website.    If you have an external adapter for your computer or laptop, try your wireless adapter in another computer to make sure the adapter is working properly.    If you have built-in wireless that came with your laptop, check to see if there is an external switch to enable or disable your wireless connection.I can connect and get to the wireless authentication page, but I can't get past that page.    Make sure you have a valid UH Username and Password.If you are still experiencing issues with wireless, or are at the UH-Manoa campus, please contact the ITS Help Desk: http://www.hawaii.edu/its/help-desk."

    "question": "Modifying your web browser cache settings",
    "answer": "Many MyUH and Laulima problems are due to web browser cache settings.&nbsp; A web browser cache stores recently downloaded pages to your local computer so future accesses to that page can be read locally rather than getting a page from the server (since it would be faster to read a stored copy than to get one from the server).&nbsp; Applications such as MyUH and Laulima need to get the current page for one to see rather than an old copy stored on your computer.Changing web browser cache settings[Internet Explorer] [Firefox (and Camino)]Internet Explorer    In the Tools Menu &gt; Select Internet Options.

    "answer": "This document will cover the basics of managing a LISTSERV list, specific to the University of Hawai&lsquo;i, including how to use, set up, and manage them.Any UH faculty, staff member, or a student is allowed to request for a mailing list. However, students must be sponsored by a faculty or staff member. List topics should be directly related to academic and/or administrative work of the University.&nbsp;&nbsp;General Information    /t/t/tWhat is a Mailing List?/t    /t/t/tHow do I request a new LISTSERV list?/t    /t/t/tList Owner's Responsibilities/tUsing LISTSERV    /t/t/tHow Can I Access LISTSERV?/t    /t/t/tWhat is the 'OK' Confirmation?/t    /t/t/tAccessing LISTSERV via the Web/t    /t/t/tCommon List Configuration Settings/t    /t/t/tCommon Tasks Using the LISTSERV Web Interface/t    /t/t/tCommon Tasks Using Email/tGetting More Help    Frequently Asked Questions    L-Soft LISTSERV Documentation&nbsp;&nbsp;General Information&nbsp;/tWhat is a Mailing List?/tA mailing list is a tool that provides users with the means to disseminate information via email to groups of people. Rather than manually entering many individual email addresses on the message, you need only enter a single email address: that of the list. This list will contain the email addresses of those in the intended audience, called subscribers, thus simplifying the task of reaching all members of the group. Making use of a mailing list is especially useful when messaging to a particular group of people is frequent.Individual mailing lists can be set up within email client software such as Microsoft Outlook, Thunderbird, Mac Mail, etc. However, these lists are specific to one account, and are only available from this account and possibly the specific email software Other people cannot use the list to send to the same group of people, unless they manually enter the group members&rsquo; email addresses or import the list from the source computer. Due to their disparate nature, these types of mailing lists can be difficult to use, share, maintain, and manage - especially at a larger scale. To address these issues, UH offers a mailing list service called Listserv.UH Listserv mailing lists are stored on the UH Listserv server. To send a message to a group of email addresses, you would only need to send the message to the Listserv list&rsquo;s email address. When the UH Listserv server receives the message, it will distribute the message to the members (subscribers) of that list. Other people besides the list's creator/owner may also be given permission to use the list's email address to distribute a message to subscribers of the list. When sending to a UH Listserv mailing list, it does not matter what computer or what email software you are using. Management and maintenance of a UH Listserv list can also be performed from any device with access to the internet, and management duties can be shared among many users if desired.The owner(s) of a Listserv list can configure it to behave differently according to their needs. The owner(s) may set specific permissions using keywords and/or templates to create different types of Listserv lists. The following are some common uses of Listserv lists:&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One-way announcement &ndash; The list owners/administrators are the only people who are allowed to send messages to the subscribers. This type of list is primarily used for newsletters, announcements, and dissemination of information that does not require feedback from the list's subscribers.&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two-way discussion &ndash; The list administrators and subscribers are all permitted to send messages to the list. This type of list is primarily used for discussion groups engaged in the exchange of ideas and information centered around a specific topic or for members of an organization to discuss ideas and information related to that organization.&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moderated &ndash; The list administrator(s) will review all incoming messages. The list administrator(s) decides whether or not to allow the message to be sent to the subscribers of the list. Moderated lists can be used to control the discussion by keeping inflammatory, inappropriate, spam, or other unwanted messages from the reaching subscribers.To use a Listserv list you would type the name of the list in the To: field of the outgoing email message. When you send the message, it will go to everyone who is subscribed to the list. For example, if there are twenty people that you normally send email to, you could create a Listserv list named &quot;group-l&quot; and add the twenty people as subscribers. The email address of this list would be group-l@lists.hawaii.edu. Once this list is created, instead of sending a message to twenty addresses:TO: user1@hawaii.edu, user2@hawaii.edu &hellip; user20@hawaii.eduCC:You would send the message to the list address:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TO: group-l@lists.hawaii.eduEveryone who is subscribed to the group-l list will receive a copy of the message. This becomes especially helpful when the amount of people you need to email is very large. Rather than typing in the addresses of everyone individually, you can create a Listserv list and enter just one address. Using a Listserv list may also help prevent messages sent to a large number of individuals from being flagged as &quot;spamming&quot; behavior by Google or other email service providers.For a more detailed description of the different features of using a mailing list, please refer to the online documentation available at: https://listserv.hawaii.edu//tHow do I request a new LISTSERV list?/t    Login to the LISTSERV request page&nbsp;with your UH username and password.    Follow the instructions on the page. You will need to supply a name for the new list (must include a hyphen), provide a description, and select one of the configuration options.    At the bottom of the page, acknowledge the terms of use (UH Executive Policy E2.210, Chapter 708, Hawaii Revised Statutes,&nbsp;List Owner's Responsibilities) by checking off the boxes and click on &quot;Request List&quot;./tList Owner's Responsibilities/tA list owner is entrusted with its members&rsquo; personal information (email address and name), and this carries certain responsibilities with regards to ensuring privacy and security. You must determine what level of security is most appropriate for your list. For example, a closed family list where all members know each other personally may be set to Review=Private (any list member may get the list of all subscribed addresses), but any list with subscriptions open to the public should be set to Review=Owners. A hobby discussion list may operate with relaxed security and deal with transgressions as they occur, but a commercial newsletter must have very tight security as any breach will reflect poorly on the department/organization&rsquo;s reputation. On an open discussion list, subscribers are aware that the discussion may sometimes stray off the topic, whereas on a moderated list they expect that you will exercise more control over what gets posted. On a one-way list, subscribers will hold you responsible for every posting.As the owner of the list, it is your responsibility to:&nbsp;    Understand your list&rsquo;s configuration.    Let subscribers know what they can expect from the list when they sign up.    Help subscribers subscribe and sign off.    Assist subscribers when they have difficulties with the list.    Ensure that the list abides by the site&rsquo;s appropriate use policy and applicable laws (for example, disallow the propagation of copyrighted materials not belonging to the sender) included in the&nbsp;UH Executive Policy E2.210 and Chapter 708, Hawaii Revised Statues.    Prevent abuse of the list by third parties. For example, always require subscription confirmations on open lists, prevent outside access to subscriber email addresses (Review=Owner), and require confirmation of all postings to one-way lists (Send=&hellip;,Confirm).    Receive and review all mail sent to the listname-request address. This address is publicized as the way to get in touch with the list owner when a subscriber or potential subscriber requires assistance.&nbsp;http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1091&nbsp;&nbsp;Using LISTSERV&nbsp;/tHow Can I Access LISTSERV?/tYou can perform actions in LISTSERV by sending a command through email or using the Web interface. Some commands are only available to LISTSERV administrators and list owners while other commands are available to subscribers and non-subscribers as well.Using Email to Communicate with LISTSERVThere are two main email addresses that are used to work with LISTSERV lists. One is to communicate with the LISTSERV program &mdash; a &ldquo;command address.&rdquo; The other is used to post mail to the list &mdash; the &ldquo;list address.&rdquo; If you want to change a list configuration or subscription setting, you would email listserv@lists.hawaii.edu. If you want to post a message to the list, you would email the list address (ex: examplelist-l@lists.hawaii.edu).&nbsp; Using the Web Interface to Communicate with LISTSERVSending email messages&nbsp;containing commands to LISTSERV and posting messages to the list is sometimes confusing for people who are new to mailing lists. To simplify this process, the Web interface provides a centralized location for interaction with LISTSERV. You can use the Web interface to issue commands directly to LISTSERV and post simple messages to the list.To access the Web interface, visit https://listserv.hawaii.edu/ and sign in using your email address (example@hawaii.edu). First time users must submit an account request by registering a password./tWhat is the 'OK' Confirmation?/tTo increase security, there are a number of actions for which LISTSERV requires confirmation before proceeding. In some cases, LISTSERV will accept a password-based validation. In other cases, email confirmation is required. When the latter happens, LISTSERV sends an email message with a subject line such as: Subject:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Command confirmation request (787EF897) The string of letters and numbers in parentheses (&ldquo;787EF897&rdquo; in the example) is called a &ldquo;cookie&rdquo; (sometimes referred to as a &ldquo;confirmation code&rdquo;) and is different for each request. Once an &ldquo;OK&rdquo; confirmation request is sent out, you must confirm it within 48 hours in order for the corresponding command to be executed.There are three methods of confirming a command:    To confirm using the Web interface, click on the link provided in the email message sent to you.    To confirm via email, reply to the email message keeping the Subject      line and cookie intact. In the body of your reply, type &ldquo;OK&rdquo;      (without the quotes).    Alternatively, you can send a new email to listserv@lists.hawaii.edu with a blank      subject line and the body of the message containing the text &ldquo;OK xxxxxxxx&rdquo; where &ldquo;xxxxxxxx&rdquo; is the cookie      from the original confirmation request email.The cookie is the most important part of the &ldquo;OK&rdquo; confirmation. LISTSERV randomly generates a new cookie for each action that requires validation.&nbsp;All privileges within LISTSERV are tied to an email address. Only someone with access to your email address can make changes to your LISTSERV account.Caution: Never &ldquo;OK&rdquo; a cookie blindly. Make sure you are confirming a command that you initiated or a message that you want distributed to the list.&nbsp;Several cases of list &ldquo;hijacking&rdquo; or spam sent to well-secured lists have been tracked back to a list owner or moderator absent-mindedly clicking an OK link that they should not have clicked./tAccessing LISTSERV via the Web/tThis article provides a quick tour of the list management areas of the web interface.

    "question": "What is a Mailing List?",
    "answer": "A mailing list is a tool that provides users with the means to disseminate information via email to groups of people. Rather than manually entering many individual email addresses on the message, you need only enter a single email address: that of the list. This list will contain the email addresses of those in the intended audience, called subscribers, thus simplifying the task of reaching all members of the group. Making use of a mailing list is especially useful when messaging to a particular group of people is frequent.Individual mailing lists can be set up within email client software such as Microsoft Outlook, Thunderbird, Mac Mail, etc. However, these lists are specific to one account, and are only available from this account and possibly the specific email software Other people cannot use the list to send to the same group of people, unless they manually enter the group members&rsquo; email addresses or import the list from the source computer. Due to their disparate nature, these types of mailing lists can be difficult to use, share, maintain, and manage - especially at a larger scale. To address these issues, UH offers a mailing list service called Listserv.UH Listserv mailing lists are stored on the UH Listserv server. To send a message to a group of email addresses, you would only need to send the message to the Listserv list&rsquo;s email address. When the UH Listserv server receives the message, it will distribute the message to the members (subscribers) of that list. Other people besides the list's creator/owner may also be given permission to use the list's email address to distribute a message to subscribers of the list. When sending to a UH Listserv mailing list, it does not matter what computer or what email software you are using. Management and maintenance of a UH Listserv list can also be performed from any device with access to the internet, and management duties can be shared among many users if desired.The owner(s) of a Listserv list can configure it to behave differently according to their needs. The owner(s) may set specific permissions using keywords and/or templates to create different types of Listserv lists. The following are some common uses of Listserv lists:&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One-way announcement &ndash; The list owners/administrators are the only people who are allowed to send messages to the subscribers. This type of list is primarily used for newsletters, announcements, and dissemination of information that does not require feedback from the list's subscribers.&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two-way discussion &ndash; The list administrators and subscribers are all permitted to send messages to the list. This type of list is primarily used for discussion groups engaged in the exchange of ideas and information centered around a specific topic or for members of an organization to discuss ideas and information related to that organization.&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moderated &ndash; The list administrator(s) will review all incoming messages. The list administrator(s) decides whether or not to allow the message to be sent to the subscribers of the list. Moderated lists can be used to control the discussion by keeping inflammatory, inappropriate, spam, or other unwanted messages from the reaching subscribers.To use a Listserv list you would type the name of the list in the To: field of the outgoing email message. When you send the message, it will go to everyone who is subscribed to the list. For example, if there are twenty people that you normally send email to, you could create a Listserv list named &quot;group-l&quot; and add the twenty people as subscribers. The email address of this list would be group-l@lists.hawaii.edu. Once this list is created, instead of sending a message to twenty addresses:TO: user1@hawaii.edu, user2@hawaii.edu &hellip; user20@hawaii.eduCC:You would send the message to the list address:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TO: group-l@lists.hawaii.eduEveryone who is subscribed to the group-l list will receive a copy of the message. This becomes especially helpful when the amount of people you need to email is very large. Rather than typing in the addresses of everyone individually, you can create a Listserv list and enter just one address. Using a Listserv list may also help prevent messages sent to a large number of individuals from being flagged as &quot;spamming&quot; behavior by Google or other email service providers.For a more detailed description of the different features of using a mailing list, please refer to the online documentation available at: https://listserv.hawaii.edu/"

Clicking on the UH LISTSERV logo on the far left will take you to the start page designated within your preferences. The button to the right of the UH LISTSERV logo can be used to toggle the navigation pane. On the right side, clicking on your email address will show your account profile. Finally, the ? button in the top-right corner will bring up documentation on the current page.&nbsp;    Navigation Pane&nbsp;&ndash; On the left side of the main form is the navigation pane. The navigation pane stays the same from page to page and contains links to various areas of the web interface that you have access to. These areas can be grouped into two main categories: List Management, and Subscriber Options.    Resources &ndash; This section contains links to general information, user documentation, frequently asked questions, and the request form for new lists.In LISTSERV 17.0, you can choose between two modes for the web interface.    Basic&nbsp;&ndash; Only the most common options are shown, but no tutorial text is displayed. This is the best mode for those users who are familiar with LISTSERV, but who are not experts and do not need to use the more advanced features. This is the default setting.    Expert&nbsp;&ndash; Similarly to Basic mode, each web page is displayed with no tutorial text. However, certain pages may contain advanced options that are not available in Basic mode. Expert mode is available for users who are very familiar with LISTSERV or need access to any advanced settings.To change the mode, click on Preferences in the Navigation Pane&nbsp;on the left. Make sure that the General tab is selected. Then, use the drop-down menu next to&nbsp;Mode&nbsp;to make the desired selection. Finally, click on the Update button to save your choice.&nbsp;List Owner ManagementBelow is a listing of list management pages accessible via the navigation pane on the left. If you are the owner of only one list, the management page for that list will be displayed. If you own more than one list, you will need to use the drop-down menu to select the list you want to modify.                                    List Dashboard                                     This section displays a user interface that organizes and presents information about your list(s). Additionally, you can&nbsp;quickly access some list configuration settings by clicking on the corresponding fields within the table.            &nbsp;                                        List Moderation                        If your list has moderation enabled, this section will display incoming messages that require approval before being forwarded out to list subscribers.            &nbsp;                                                    List Configuration                                     This section displays various settings for lists you own.

    "question": "List Owner's Responsibilities",
    "answer": "A list owner is entrusted with its members&rsquo; personal information (email address and name), and this carries certain responsibilities with regards to ensuring privacy and security. You must determine what level of security is most appropriate for your list. For example, a closed family list where all members know each other personally may be set to Review=Private (any list member may get the list of all subscribed addresses), but any list with subscriptions open to the public should be set to Review=Owners. A hobby discussion list may operate with relaxed security and deal with transgressions as they occur, but a commercial newsletter must have very tight security as any breach will reflect poorly on the department/organization&rsquo;s reputation. On an open discussion list, subscribers are aware that the discussion may sometimes stray off the topic, whereas on a moderated list they expect that you will exercise more control over what gets posted. On a one-way list, subscribers will hold you responsible for every posting.As the owner of the list, it is your responsibility to:&nbsp;    Understand your list&rsquo;s configuration.    Let subscribers know what they can expect from the list when they sign up.    Help subscribers subscribe and sign off.    Assist subscribers when they have difficulties with the list.    Ensure that the list abides by the site&rsquo;s appropriate use policy and applicable laws (for example, disallow the propagation of copyrighted materials not belonging to the sender) included in the&nbsp;UH Executive Policy E2.210 and Chapter 708, Hawaii Revised Statues.    Prevent abuse of the list by third parties. For example, always require subscription confirmations on open lists, prevent outside access to subscriber email addresses (Review=Owner), and require confirmation of all postings to one-way lists (Send=&hellip;,Confirm).    Receive and review all mail sent to the listname-request address. This address is publicized as the way to get in touch with the list owner when a subscriber or potential subscriber requires assistance.&nbsp;http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1091&nbsp;"

    "question": "Getting Started with LISTSERV (Subscribers)",

Rather than manually entering many individual email addresses on the message, you need only enter a single email address: that of the list. This list will contain the email addresses of those in the intended audience, called subscribers, thus simplifying the task of reaching all members of the group. Making use of a mailing list is especially useful when messaging to a particular group of people is frequent.Individual mailing lists can be set up within email client software such as Microsoft Outlook, Thunderbird, Mac Mail, etc. However, these lists are specific to one account, and are only available from this account and possibly the specific email software Other people cannot use the list to send to the same group of people, unless they manually enter the group members&rsquo; email addresses or import the list from the source computer. Due to their disparate nature, these types of mailing lists can be difficult to use, share, maintain, and manage - especially at a larger scale. To address these issues, UH offers a mailing list service called Listserv.UH Listserv mailing lists are stored on the UH Listserv server. To send a message to a group of email addresses, you would only need to send the message to the Listserv list&rsquo;s email address. When the UH Listserv server receives the message, it will distribute the message to the members (subscribers) of that list. Other people besides the list's creator/owner may also be given permission to use the list's email address to distribute a message to subscribers of the list. When sending to a UH Listserv mailing list, it does not matter what computer or what email software you are using. Management and maintenance of a UH Listserv list can also be performed from any device with access to the internet, and management duties can be shared among many users if desired.The owner(s) of a Listserv list can configure it to behave differently according to their needs. The owner(s) may set specific permissions using keywords and/or templates to create different types of Listserv lists. The following are some common uses of Listserv lists:&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One-way announcement &ndash; The list owners/administrators are the only people who are allowed to send messages to the subscribers. This type of list is primarily used for newsletters, announcements, and dissemination of information that does not require feedback from the list's subscribers.&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two-way discussion &ndash; The list administrators and subscribers are all permitted to send messages to the list. This type of list is primarily used for discussion groups engaged in the exchange of ideas and information centered around a specific topic or for members of an organization to discuss ideas and information related to that organization.&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moderated &ndash; The list administrator(s) will review all incoming messages. The list administrator(s) decides whether or not to allow the message to be sent to the subscribers of the list. Moderated lists can be used to control the discussion by keeping inflammatory, inappropriate, spam, or other unwanted messages from the reaching subscribers.To use a Listserv list you would type the name of the list in the To: field of the outgoing email message. When you send the message, it will go to everyone who is subscribed to the list. For example, if there are twenty people that you normally send email to, you could create a Listserv list named &quot;group-l&quot; and add the twenty people as subscribers. The email address of this list would be group-l@lists.hawaii.edu. Once this list is created, instead of sending a message to twenty addresses:TO: user1@hawaii.edu, user2@hawaii.edu &hellip; user20@hawaii.eduCC:You would send the message to the list address:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TO: group-l@lists.hawaii.eduEveryone who is subscribed to the group-l list will receive a copy of the message. This becomes especially helpful when the amount of people you need to email is very large. Rather than typing in the addresses of everyone individually, you can create a Listserv list and enter just one address. Using a Listserv list may also help prevent messages sent to a large number of individuals from being flagged as &quot;spamming&quot; behavior by Google or other email service providers.For a more detailed description of the different features of using a mailing list, please refer to the online documentation available at: https://listserv.hawaii.edu/&nbsp;Using LISTSERV/tHow Can I Access LISTSERV?/tYou can perform actions in LISTSERV by sending a command through email or using the Web interface. Some commands are only available to LISTSERV administrators and list owners while other commands are available to subscribers and non-subscribers as well.Using Email to Communicate with LISTSERVThere are two main email addresses that are used to work with LISTSERV lists. One is to communicate with the LISTSERV program &mdash; a &ldquo;command address.&rdquo; The other is used to post mail to the list &mdash; the &ldquo;list address.&rdquo; If you want to change a list configuration or subscription setting, you would email listserv@lists.hawaii.edu. If you want to post a message to the list, you would email the list address (ex: examplelist-l@lists.hawaii.edu).&nbsp; Using the Web Interface to Communicate with LISTSERVSending email messages&nbsp;containing commands to LISTSERV and posting messages to the list is sometimes confusing for people who are new to mailing lists. To simplify this process, the Web interface provides a centralized location for interaction with LISTSERV. You can use the Web interface to issue commands directly to LISTSERV and post simple messages to the list.To access the Web interface, visit https://listserv.hawaii.edu/ and sign in using your email address (example@hawaii.edu). First time users must submit an account request by registering a password./tWhat is the 'OK' Confirmation?/tTo increase security, there are a number of actions for which LISTSERV requires confirmation before proceeding. In some cases, LISTSERV will accept a password-based validation. In other cases, email confirmation is required. When the latter happens, LISTSERV sends an email message with a subject line such as: Subject:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Command confirmation request (787EF897) The string of letters and numbers in parentheses (&ldquo;787EF897&rdquo; in the example) is called a &ldquo;cookie&rdquo; (sometimes referred to as a &ldquo;confirmation code&rdquo;) and is different for each request. Once an &ldquo;OK&rdquo; confirmation request is sent out, you must confirm it within 48 hours in order for the corresponding command to be executed.There are three methods of confirming a command:    To confirm using the Web interface, click on the link provided in the email message sent to you.    To confirm via email, reply to the email message keeping the Subject      line and cookie intact. In the body of your reply, type &ldquo;OK&rdquo;      (without the quotes).    Alternatively, you can send a new email to listserv@lists.hawaii.edu with a blank      subject line and the body of the message containing the text &ldquo;OK xxxxxxxx&rdquo; where &ldquo;xxxxxxxx&rdquo; is the cookie      from the original confirmation request email.The cookie is the most important part of the &ldquo;OK&rdquo; confirmation. LISTSERV randomly generates a new cookie for each action that requires validation.&nbsp;All privileges within LISTSERV are tied to an email address. Only someone with access to your email address can make changes to your LISTSERV account.Caution: Never &ldquo;OK&rdquo; a cookie blindly. Make sure you are confirming a command that you initiated or a message that you want distributed to the list.&nbsp;Several cases of list &ldquo;hijacking&rdquo; or spam sent to well-secured lists have been tracked back to a list owner or moderator absent-mindedly clicking an OK link that they should not have clicked./tAccessing LISTSERV via the Web (Subscribers)/tThis section provides a quick tour of the&nbsp;subscriber view of the Web interface.

    "question": "How to avoid SQL injection attacks",
    "answer": "If you do any programming that takes user input to make dynamic SQL statements, be aware of SQL injection attacks. If you do not take precautions against this type of attack, a malicious user can insert SQL statements that can return more data than intended or cause damage to your database. This could lead to an exploit that compromises the web server.Minimizing RiskWe suggest the following techniques to minimize the risk1:    Validate user input. If you are expecting a number, check that you receive a number.    Use functions like htmlspecialchars, stripslashes, and mysql_real_escape_string to clean malicious input.External Links:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injectionhttp://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-real-escape-string.phphttps://secure.php.net/manual/en/security.database.sql-injection.phpAt a minimum, data that will be incorporated into SQL queries for a MySQL database should be sanitized using the mysqli_real_escape_string function.&nbsp; Ideally, prepared statements with placeholders should be used when querying a database.The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) has a cheat sheet on methods to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities:https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet&nbsp;PHP Sample code    Remove non-alphanumeric characters from input        //get raw input    $input = $_REQUEST['input'];      //characters not allowed in input    $pattern = &quot;/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/&quot;; // regex pattern means: all characters NOT in a-z, A-Z and 0-9        //remove all characters that are not allowed    $input = preg_replace($pattern, &quot;&quot;, $input);        //build SQL statement with validated input    //$dbconnect is the database connection    $sql = 'SELECT * FROM table WHERE field = &quot;' . mysqli_real_escape_string($dbconnect, $input) . '&quot;;';    Only run query if input is numeric        if (is_numeric($_REQUEST['input'])) {    &nbsp; &nbsp; //build SQL statement with validated input    &nbsp; &nbsp; $sql = 'SELECT * FROM table WHERE field = ' . $input . ';';    }    Clean malicious input with htmlspecialchars, stripslashes, and mysql_real_escape_string        // you can nest the functions    $username = htmlspecialchars(stripslashes($_REQUEST['username']));        // or use them individually    // $dbconnect is the database connection    $sql = 'SELECT * FROM table WHERE username = &quot;' . mysqli_real_escape_string($dbconnect, $username) . '&quot;;';1&nbsp;Because the ITS hosted web sites uses PHP, this article references PHP functions, has PHP external links and the examples are in PHP. Regardless of the programming language you use, there should be similar functionality available."

    "question": "Laulima: Upload & Download Multiple Files via WebDAV",
    "answer": "Laulima: Upload &amp; Download Multiple Files via WebDAVWebDAV stands for &quot;Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning&rdquo;. WebDAV can be used to manage files (eg. upload/download) on remote web servers (eg. Laulima). The interface is similar to having an external hard drive/flash drive attached to your computer, allowing you to drag copies of multiple files to the server.For more information on WebDAV see: http://webdav.orgYou can use WebDAV to upload multiple files to the Resources Tool in Laulima. You can also access information on how to do this via the &ldquo;Transfer Files&rdquo; tab in the Resources Tool within Laulima or at the TALENT page (http://www.hawaii.edu/talent).WebDAV works differently depending on which computer operating system and version you use (eg. Windows 7, Windows 10, Mac OSX). Listed below is basic information on setting up some common operating systems to connect with Laulima via WebDAV.Microsoft Windows 8/10Mac OSXLinuxOther (Cyberduck)Microsoft Windows 10    From the Desktop, click File Explorer and make sure 'This PC' is selected in the left-hand pane.    At the top of the File Explorer window, click Computer &gt; Map Network Drive &gt; Map network drive.    Select a vacant drive letter (e.g., Z) from the Drive drop down menu.    In the Folder field, type (or copy and paste) the URL for this site (shown near the top of the Transfer Files area). Click Finish.    When prompted, enter your username and password and click OK.    You can now drag files and folders to and from your computer and the site Resources folder.Alternate method of setting up WebDAV on Windows:If  the process above yields connections errors, you may  be able to  utilize the WebDAV functionality to access your files using a  free  third-party client called Cyberduck.Microsoft Windows 11    From the Desktop, click File Explorer and make sure 'This PC' is selected in the left-hand pane.

These files are referred to as attachments . Any kind of computer file can be an attachment: a word processing file, a spreadsheet, a database, an audio or video file, etc. However, please be advised that email with certain extensions are deleted&nbsp;due to&nbsp;security&nbsp;risks&nbsp;e.g. viruses or other damaging programs. For more information, please refer to: http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=6590Although the recipient may be able to receive&nbsp;an attachment, the file is not usable if the recipient does not also have the appropriate program to read the file. For example, if you send an MS Word file to a person who uses Word Perfect, the recipient may not be able to use the file. Likewise, there are sometimes problems involved in sending files between PCs and Macs.In addition, Google imposes a maximum email size limit of 25 MB. (As a caution, large files take up valuable quota disk space and should be off-loaded to your personal computer.) As an alternative, please see the File Drop service at: http://www.hawaii.edu/filedrop for transferring large files.To send an attachment: compose a message and click Attach a file (next to paper clip) on the tool bar. Use the browser to find the file to attach and click Open to attach the file. (If your files&nbsp;are large you may see a progress bar as your file is uploaded) To attach another file click on Attach another file and follow the same procedures. To&nbsp;remove an attachment&nbsp;, uncheck the box for&nbsp;appropriate file.&nbsp;It is good practice to mention that you are sending an attachment and specify its format. (For example: &quot;I am attaching a spreadsheet in MS Excel 2003 format.&quot;)To receive an attachment: Read the message as you normally would.&nbsp;If there is an attachment, they will be displayed below the message. Depending on the attachment type, you may have several options to choose from. (Open as Google document, View, View as HTML, etc) You can also choose to Download the attachment to your computer, or if there are multiple attachments 'Download all attachments&quot; (in a zip file).For more information on attachments, go to http://mail.google.com/support/bin/topic.py?hl=en&amp;topic=12834&nbsp;./tUsing Contacts (Address Book) in Google@UH Gmail/tGmail has a simple Contacts feature.

    "question": "Using Attachments in Google@UH Gmail",
    "answer": "It is possible to send files to another person by attaching them to email messages. These files are referred to as attachments . Any kind of computer file can be an attachment: a word processing file, a spreadsheet, a database, an audio or video file, etc. However, please be advised that email with certain extensions are deleted&nbsp;due to&nbsp;security&nbsp;risks&nbsp;e.g. viruses or other damaging programs. For more information, please refer to: http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=6590Although the recipient may be able to receive&nbsp;an attachment, the file is not usable if the recipient does not also have the appropriate program to read the file. For example, if you send an MS Word file to a person who uses Word Perfect, the recipient may not be able to use the file. Likewise, there are sometimes problems involved in sending files between PCs and Macs.In addition, Google imposes a maximum email size limit of 25 MB. (As a caution, large files take up valuable quota disk space and should be off-loaded to your personal computer.) As an alternative, please see the File Drop service at: http://www.hawaii.edu/filedrop for transferring large files.To send an attachment: compose a message and click Attach a file (next to paper clip) on the tool bar. Use the browser to find the file to attach and click Open to attach the file. (If your files&nbsp;are large you may see a progress bar as your file is uploaded) To attach another file click on Attach another file and follow the same procedures. To&nbsp;remove an attachment&nbsp;, uncheck the box for&nbsp;appropriate file.&nbsp;It is good practice to mention that you are sending an attachment and specify its format. (For example: &quot;I am attaching a spreadsheet in MS Excel 2003 format.&quot;)To receive an attachment: Read the message as you normally would.&nbsp;If there is an attachment, they will be displayed below the message. Depending on the attachment type, you may have several options to choose from. (Open as Google document, View, View as HTML, etc) You can also choose to Download the attachment to your computer, or if there are multiple attachments 'Download all attachments&quot; (in a zip file).For more information on attachments, go to http://mail.google.com/support/bin/topic.py?hl=en&amp;topic=12834&nbsp;."

Repeat steps 5 - 7 and create folders for all the different folders that you wish to copy off of the server (e.g. Drafts, Sent, Trash, etc.).When you are done, if necessary, click on the arrow next to UH Email Archive&nbsp;to expand and show what's stored inside.&nbsp; Your Local Folders should look similar to below, except with your information:Moving email to your local foldersYou should try the following steps on a small amount of messages first.&nbsp; Be sure you are comfortable with this process before attempting to move a large amount of email or email from a critical folder such as Sent or Inbox.&nbsp;If you are also logged into your Google@UH Gmail in a web browser, it is recommended that you log out of the browser before beginning the steps below.    You first have to select the folder that contains the messages you want to move.&nbsp; In this example, we will archive messages from the &quot;meetings&quot; folder.&nbsp; On the left side of the screen, click on the folder &quot;meetings&quot; that's listed under the &quot;username@hawaii.edu&quot; section (do not select the one under &quot;UH Email Archive&quot;).        Select the messages you wish to archive. Use Shift+Click to select a number of messages in a row. Use Ctrl+Click to select multiple individual messages spaced apart. Use Ctrl+A (or Option+A on Mac) to select all messages in a folder. Note, selecting all messages in a folder with a large amount of email may result in slow performance.        Right-click one of the selected messages and select Move To &gt; Local Folders &gt; UH Email Archive &gt; and finally the meetings&nbsp;folder. &quot;Move To&quot; will move messages from one folder to another, while leaving an archived copy on the server. Select &quot;Copy To&quot; instead to make a local copy while leaving the message on the server in its original location. Note, selecting &quot;Copy To&quot; or &quot;Move To&quot; will not reduce your storage quota usage unless you later delete the messages from the server (in other words, delete the messages from your Google@UH Gmail or from Thunderbird under the &quot;username@hawaii.edu&quot; section).        The highlighted messages will be moved to the meetings folder.&nbsp; Depending on how many messages you selected to move, this could take some time.        On the left side, select the meetings folder under the UH Email Archive section and verify the messages are there.&nbsp; If you used &quot;Copy To&quot;,Once you have verified that the messages were successfully moved, you may delete them from the server (in other words, delete the messages from your Google@UH Gmail or from Thunderbird under the &quot;username@hawaii.edu&quot; section).        Repeat steps 1 - 5 for each of the folders that you wish to move off of the server.Backing up your archived emailNow that you have an archive of emails stored on your local storage, you may want to make a backup to store on an external hard drive, thumb drive, other external media, or a cloud storage account.        Right-click on the Local Folders folder in Thunderbird.            Select Settings.            Next to the Local Directory, select Browse...        Copy the entire &quot;Local Folders&quot; folder to your external storage media (right click on the folder and select Copy, Right click in your media and select Paste). You may need to exit Thunderbird for the copy operation to complete. Be sure you are only copying the &quot;Local Folders&quot; folder and are not moving it. Moving the folder will result in you being unable to view the archived emails in Thunderbird.Restoring a backed up archiveShould you need to restore archived emails that you had previously backed up, you will need to take the archive backup you have stored on your external hard drive, thumb drive, other external media, or cloud storage account, and copy it back to your local storage.        Right-click on the&nbsp;Local Folders&nbsp;folder in Thunderbird.            Select&nbsp;Settings.            Next to the path shown at Local Directory, select&nbsp;Browse...        Find the &quot;Local Folders&quot; backup that you stored previously and copy it to the directory shown in step 3 above. You may want to rename the folder in order to better distinguish between the items you are restoring and the items that may already exist in your Thunderbird's Local Folders.        Restart Thunderbird and click on the arrow next to Local Folders to expand the folder and show your restored email."

    "question": "Why don't I receive a copy of my own message when sending to a LISTSERV list?",
    "answer": "Gmail recognizes that the incoming message is identical to the copy in your Sent Items and does not duplicate it to your inbox.Google's recommendation is that you cc yourself when sending messages to a mailing list from your Google@UH Gmail account. Since you are unable to receive copies of your own messages, another available option is to enable the ACK setting, which is an acknowledgement email from LISTSERV that your message was sent to X number of recipients. In addition, if your list has archives enabled, you can see if your message was posted to the list by checking the archives..To change your current ACK settings, you may do the following:A. Enable ACK in your subscription options    Under Subscriber Options&nbsp;in the navigation pane on the left, select&nbsp;Subscriptions.    Click on the name of the list you want to enable acknowledgements for.    Click on the menu button along the right-side of the page (it should look like three horizontal lines stacked together). Then, click on Subscribe or Unsubscribe.    In the Acknowledgements section, select&nbsp;Short Message Confirming Receipt. Then, click on Update Settings.B. Enable ACK as default for new subscribers (List Owners Only)    Under the List Management options in the navigation pane on the left, select List Configuration.    Click on the Subscriptions tab.    Select the list that you are modifying from the drop-down menu. Then, scroll down to Default-Options.    Add the keyword ACK&nbsp;to the text field. If there are already other keywords listed as Default-Options, simply add a comma followed by the keyword ACK&nbsp;to the end. Then, click on Update.C. Enable ACK for existing subscribers (List Owners Only)    Under the&nbsp;List Management&nbsp;options in the navigation pane on the left, select&nbsp;Subscriber Reports.    Select the list that you are modifying from the drop-down menu.    Click on Customize Report&nbsp;and check Acknowledgements.&nbsp;Then, click on Update.    Use the check boxes on the left to select specific subscribers (or click on Check All to select all subscribers) and, using the drop-down menu at the bottom of the Acknowledgements column, select Ack.

    "question": "Securing Windows Servers",
    "answer": "It is important when installing and maintaining a Microsoft Windows server to perform initial and maintenance security checks on the server. Below is a checklist of basic tasks that should be performed on each server on initial setup and monthly to ensure continued security of the server. Please note that adding additional services like SQL server requires additional tasks to be performed routinely.Windows Update - One of the most important steps when installing a new Windows server is to perform all of the critical Windows Updates. If possible install Windows from media slipstreamed with the most current service packs and install updates from media such as a DVD before connecting it to the network for the first time. If that is not possible ensure the Windows Firewall is turned on when you connect the server to the network to patch it.AntiVirus - Installing AntiVirus is an important step in securing your server. For servers that are part of the University of Hawaii, you can download and install McAfee at www.hawaii.edu/software&nbsp; Verify that the server is getting updated virus definitions often.MS Baseline Security Analyzer - Download and run the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer to find any potential holes or missed patches http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/cc184924Windows Firewall - Ensure that the Windows Firewall is turned on and that only the services and ports necessary are allowed for inbound and outbound traffic. Check this often and close ports that are no longer needed.Change network scanner default password - If there is a scanner attached to the network it is important to change the default password. You can find information on doing this in the manual for your model of scanner.If IIS is on, restrict IIS by subnet - If possible limit access to IIS by subnet.Anonymous FTP - Evaluate if having anonymous FTP enabled is necessary for your server and if possible restrict access by IP address.Remove &quot;Everyone&quot; from data directories - When creating new shared directories, ensure that the &quot;Everyone&quot; group is removed from the share and security permissions.Set Administrator password to something difficult - For auditing and security measures it is best to reset the Administator password to something difficult like a passphrase and use separate Admin accounts per user. Do not disable this account as some functions can only be done as this user.Create personal admin accounts - Create personal admin accounts instead of allowing everyone to use the same account. This will allow for better tracking in logs of who has made changes to the server.Set personal admin password to expire in 1 year - To ensure the continued security of the server, set the personal admin passwords to expire after a year to force admins to set a new password.Using SQL Express - If using SQL Express, the built in administrator account &quot;sa&quot; by defaut has no password. You must install the SQL Management Studio to set the password.Rename any accounts called &quot;backup&quot; - Rename any default backup accounts thathave a username that could be easily guessed by a hacker.Make sure &quot;guest&quot; account is disabled - Always ensure that the built in &quot;guest&quot; account is disabled.Make sure minimum services necessary are turned on&nbsp; - In the server manager, make sure that only the services that you need are turned on for each server.Patch 3rd party software - Make sure that all 3rd party software (such as Adobe) are patched regularly.Logging - Turn on logging for services and applications. Review logs at least monthly for unauthorized activity.Unused Accounts - Verify that all usused accounts have either been removed or disabled.Check Administrator group - Check this group to ensure no unauthorized changes have been made to membership.Related ArticlesSecuring Linux ServersSecuring Mac Servers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"

    "question": "Protecting Sensitive Information at UH",
    "answer": "The University of Hawai?i (UH) is an extensive and multifaceted organization dedicated to the highest standards of scholarship and service, which requires an open flow of information and communication. Unfortunately, over the last decade, the emergence of increasing abuse by criminals of personal information used by universities, such as social security numbers and credit card or other banking information, has challenged the decentralized culture of free flow of information. In order to protect the personal, confidential information it is entrusted with, UH must comply with local and state laws and federal requirements such as but not limited to: FERPA, HIPAA, PCI, FTC and FISMA.University Data Governance and Data Classification PoliciesE2.215 Institutional Data Governance - Established to provide principles governing the management and use of data and information at the University, including, but not limited to, the collection and creation, privacy and security, and the integrity and quality of that data and information.E2.214 Data Classification Categories - Established to organize UH Institutional Data into data classification categories based on the different levels of security risk and penalties that may result from inadvertent exposure and inappropriate disclosure of those data. The categories are: Public, Restricted, Sensitive, and Regulated.Other related policies can be found here: https://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/policies/Data Categorizations:Institutional Data&mdash;data the University of Hawai?i uses for administrative and academic duties&mdash;can be categorized based on different levels of security risk and penalties that may result from inadvertent exposure and inappropriate disclosure of that data.    Public: Institutional Data where access is not restricted and is subject to open records requests. This includes student directory information and public employee information.    Restricted: Institutional Data used for UH business only. Restricted data will not be distributed to external parties except under the terms of a written memorandum of agreement of contract. Examples include UH email, UH ID number and UH ID card.    Sensitive: Institutional Data subject to privacy or security considerations or any Institutional Data not designated as public, restricted, or regulated. Examples include student grades, student and employee date of birth and salary information. UH research data or other UH intellectual property is also considered Sensitive Data.    Regulated: Institutional Data where inadvertent disclosure or inappropriate access requires a breach notification in accordance with HRS &sect;487N or is subject to financial fines. Driver&rsquo;s license numbers, Social Security Number (SSN) and personal financial or health information fall within this category.Additional examples can be found at: https://datagov.intranet.hawaii.edu/institutional-data-classification-levels/ [UH Login Required].What is Personally Identifiable Information (PII)?Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is the type of information that needs to be protected because the inadvertent disclosure or inappropriate access requires a breach notification or is subject to financial fines. Information such as Social Security Numbers, Driver&rsquo;s License numbers or Hawai?i Identification Card numbers, Financial Account numbers, PCI-DSS information, and Health information, including anything covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) are categorized as &quot;Regulated&quot; by the University of Hawai?i.Minimum Security StandardsAs part of the UH Data Classifications (EP2.214) technical guidelines for each data classification category shall be followed to prevent the inadvertent exposure and inappropriate disclosure of Institutional Data that are considered protected data. The latest minimum security standards are available at https://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/minimum-standards/.Do you handle PII, &quot;UH Sensitive&quot;, or &quot;UH Regulated&quot; data?Any UH employee or UH affiliated individual that accesses PII must acknowledge the online General Confidentiality Notice (GCN) found at https://www.hawaii.edu/its/acer/. The General Confidentiality Notice identifies some examples of PII (note that it is not exhaustive). The document also identifies the responsibilities of people who have access to such information.You will also need to take the Information Security Awareness Training found in Laulima. This brief course goes over various topics, such as data breaches, securing information, and UH policies. A link to the Security Awareness Training could be found here: https://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/training/.Do you store &quot;UH Regulated&quot; data electronically or in paper format?Per Hawai&lsquo;i State Law and UH Policy, any individual, department, or unit storing Personally Identifiable Information, regardless if it is paper or electronic, needs to be reported. For the University of Hawai&lsquo;i, this information needs to be reported in the Personal Information Survey site. The information survey MUST be reviewed and updated annually.Information Security Program Requirements: Server Registration and Personally Identifiable Information Scanning:Any server operating on the University of Hawai&lsquo;i network (regardless if it is behind a firewall) must be registered in the Server Registration database, accessible here: https://www.hawaii.edu/its/server/registration/. Servers will also need to be scanned for vulnerabilities and personally identifiable information annually. More information on this requirement can be found here: https://hawaii.edu/askus/1312.PII Scanning with Spirion (formerly Identity Finder):&nbsp; To determine if your server contains PII, a scan using Spirion or Find_SSN will be required.

    "question": "Setting up Encryption in Windows",
    "answer": "Encryption is used to secure data that others shouldn't be able to read; for example, social security numbers (SSN) or financial data. These are suggested methods for using encryption in Windows, but they should always be used with discretion and caution. (You don't want to lock yourself out from the information either.) It is also highly advisable to make a backup of your information before implementing.As a best practice, whenever using encryption, create the necessary backups, recovery keys, certificate exports, etc. necessary to ensure you have a way to restore or recover your data.BitLocker - Full Disk Encryption    Windows 10 Professional provides disk encryption through BitLocker Drive Encryption. Microsoft describes BitLocker as, 'A data protection feature that integrates with the operating system and addresses the threats of data theft or exposure from lost, stolen, or inappropriately decommissioned computers. BitLocker provides the most protection when used with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 1.2 or later. The TPM is a hardware component installed in many newer computers by the computer manufacturers. It works with BitLocker to help protect user data and to ensure that a computer has not been tampered with while the system was offline.'Contact site licensing at https://www.hawaii.edu/sitelic/ to ensure you purchase the correct version of Windows 10 to use BitLocker Drive Encryption.If you enable BitLocker Drive Encryption, it is imperative you backup the recovery key during setup. If you do not backup your recovery key, your data will not be recoverable.Internal Drive - Full Disk Encryption    Turn on BitLocker                    Type BitLocker in the Windows search box, then press Enter.            Select Turn on BitLocker                BitLocker Recovery Key Backup Options                    IMPORTANT: Be sure to record and keep this BitLocker recovery key in a safe place. You cannot access the data without this recovery key.            BitLocker gives you three options: Save to your Microsoft Account, Save to a file, or Print the recovery key. Choose the option that works best for you.                Select how much of the disk to encrypt                    Encrypt entire drive (slower but better for PCs and drives already in use)                Select Encryption Mode                    The ability to choose your encryption mode is a new feature in Windows 10. Select the encryption option that matches your situation. We recommend New encryption mode                BitLocker System Check                    It is recommended to run a BitLocker system check first before encrypting your drive. This ensures BitLocker can read your recovery key before starting the drive encryption.            When ready, select 'Start encrypting' to begin the BitLocker process of encrypting your hard drive.            External Drive (Portable HardDrive, FlashDrive) - Full Disk Encryption    Plug in your external drive to an avaialbe USB slot    Type BitLocker in the Windows search box, then press Enter.    Under the Removeable data drives - BitLocker To Go heading, Click Turn on BitLocker    On the Choose how you want to unlock this drive window, Check Use a password to unlock the drive    Create a strong password that will be used to unlock the drive    Backup your recovery key using one or more of the available options    Select Encrypt Entire Drive    Select Compatible mode if you will be using the exteranl drive on older Windows versions, otherwise select New encryption mode    Read the prompt, and then click Start encrypting    Do not move or make changes to files or unplug it while it is being encryptedBitLocker Resources    BitLocker and Windows 10 Pro Protect your data    Bitlocker OverviewFile and Folder EncryptionMicrosoft also offers the ability to encrypt files and folders in Windows 10. File and folder encryption can be done in addition with BitLocker Drive Encryption.    Below are steps on encrypting files and folders, backing up your personal certificate, and decrypting files and folders.Encrypting Files and Folders    Click Start, point to All Programs, point to Accessories, then click on Windows Explorer    Locate and right-click on the file or folder* that you want to encrypt and click Properties.    On the General tab, click Advanced.    Under Compress or Encrypt attributes, select the Encrypt contents to secure data check box, and then click OK.    Click on OK to close the folders Properties window.    In the Confirm Attribute Changes dialog box, choose one.                    If you want to encrypt only the folder, click Apply changes to this folder only, and then click OK.            If you want to encrypt the contents in the folder along with the folder click Apply changes to this folder, subfolders and files, and then click OK.            If you want to encrypt only the file, click “Encrypt the file only” and click OK.                Windows will now proceed to encrypt your data. How long it takes depends on the amount and size of the files you choose to encrypt. When it is complete the folder will be encrypted. However, this does not mean that others cannot view the contents of the folder. Encrypting the files prevents them from opening items in the encrypted folder.Note: While it is possible to encrypt both files and folders, Microsoft's Best Practices suggest encrypting folders not individual files. This prevents applications from unintentionally removing the encryption from a file.Things to do after you encrypt your dataOnce you have encrypted your files or folders, it is important to backup your certificate to not lose access should you forget your password. If you do not backup your certificate and subsequently forget your password, there will be no way to recover your data. Back up your certificate and store it in a secure location.Backup your Certificate    Start Microsoft Internet Explorer    On the Tools menu, click Internet Options    On the Content tab, in the Certificates section, click Certificates.    Click the Personal tab.                    Note: You may have multiple certificates listed. Click on each one until you find the certificate with the intended purposes field showing 'Encrypting File System'                Click Export to start the Certificate Export Wizard, and then click Next.    Click 'Yes, export the private key' to export the private key, and then click Next.    Ensure the checkboxes next to “Include all certificates in the certification path if possible” and 'Enable certificate privacy' are checked and click Next.    Click the Password checkbox, set the Encryption to AES256-SHA256, enter and confirm a password, then click Next. This password is to protect the exported certificate.    Specify the location of where you want to save the certificate. You can back up to another location on your hard-drive or a USB drive. You can also back up the certificate to multiple locations.    Specify the destination, click Save, and then Next.    Click Finish. You should be told the export was successful. Click OK.    Click Close to close the certificates window, then click OK to close the Internet Options window.Decrypting Files of FoldersDecrypting a folder uses basically the same process of encrypting the file, but in reverse order.            Right-click on the folder or file you want to decrypt, then click Properties.        Click Advanced    Click to clear the Encrypt contents to secure data check box to decrypt    Click OK to close the Advanced Attributes dialog box.    Click on ok to close the folders Properties window    If it is a folder, and it has files in it, the Confirm Attribute Changes dialog box appears. You can choose to decrypt only the folder, but this won&rsquo;t decrypt any of the files in the folder.    If you want to decrypt all the contents of the folder, click Apply changes to this folder, subfolders, and files, and then click OK."

    "question": "Securing Linux Servers",
    "answer": "It is important when installing and maintaining a Linux server to perform initial and maintenance security checks on the server. Below is a checklist of basic tasks that should be performed on each server on initial setup and monthly to ensure continued security of the server. Please note that adding additional services like MySQL or Apache requires additional tasks to be performed routinely.Choosing a Distro - Linux servers come in many flavors (distributions) and you should choose one that you are familiar with and suits your needs.&nbsp; When choosing a distribution, you should note at what point in its life cycle your current distribution lies.&nbsp; Distributions will typically state how long they will provide updates for their product and if you plan on using the server for longer than the time listed, you should schedule time to upgrade the system before the cutoff date or possibly look for a distribution with a longer life cycle.&nbsp; Larger, more popular distributions are also recommended as distros with small developer lists and user bases are more likely to end-prematurely due to lack of funding or interest.Installing Linux - When installing linux in a production environment, it is recommended that you only install the services and applications that are required to accomplish the task the server needs to provide.&nbsp; Choose a custom installation if possible as &ldquo;default installs&rdquo; may install many extra programs and services that will not be used.&nbsp; Vulnerabilities in these applications and services could be used to make your server vulnerable to attack.&nbsp; &lsquo;Server&rsquo; or &lsquo;Minimal&rsquo; installs may be available depending on distro and should be leveraged for maximum benefit.Software Update - One of the most important steps after installing a new Linux server is to bring your server up to date by performing a software update. The software update process differs between linux distributions, so please acquaint yourself with the update program that your particular distro uses.&nbsp; For reference, &lsquo;apt&rsquo; and &lsquo;yum&rsquo; are two popular package managers that are commonly used among current distributions. If the distribution you are installing from isn&rsquo;t up to date, make sure to check that your firewall is set properly before updating to disallow access to your computer&rsquo;s services as your updates are being installed.&nbsp; Regularly schedule a time to run software updates to the system.Firewall - Ensure that your server&rsquo;s firewall is turned on and that only the services and ports necessary are allowed for inbound and outbound traffic. Check this often and close ports that are no longer needed.&nbsp; If possible, limit access to services by subnet or IP.SELinux &ndash; If not installed by your distro by default, install SELinux and set it to &lsquo;enforcing&rsquo; mode.&nbsp; You can disable individual policies as needed for your system but do not completely disable or set to permissive mode to bypass the SELinux rulesets.Restricting Services by Subnet/IP - If possible through service configuration, limit access to your services by subnet or IP address.Limit sudo use &ndash; Sudo is convenient, but requiring root login can make it more difficult for someone to get full access to the system.Set Administrator password to something difficult - For auditing and security purposes it is best to set user and the root passwords to something using upper and lower case characters, numbers, special characters and a length greater than 8.&nbsp; Do not use the same password for multiple users (including root), and refrain from using words that can be found in a dictionary.Set Password Expiration - To ensure the continued security of the server over time, set passwords to expire after a year to force users to set new passwords.Disable/Remove Guest Accounts - Always ensure that all &quot;guest&quot; accounts (if any) are disabled or removed.Service Accounts - Check out the shadow and password file to verify that accounts created for services cannot be used to login to the system.Minimal Services - make sure that only the services that you need are running on each server, and check that only the services you want are scheduled to be turned on at server reboot.Patch 3rd party software - Make sure that all 3rd party software installed on the system are patched regularly.Logging - Turn on logging for services and applications. Review logs at least monthly for unauthorized activity.&nbsp; Many distributions have logwatching programs available that email log sumarries daily to the administrator.Unused Accounts - Verify that all usused accounts have either been removed or disabled.Related ArticlesSecuring&nbsp;Windows ServersSecuring Mac Servers&nbsp;"

It requires python version 2.4+ to run. By default Find_SSNs searches the following file types: doc, docx, xlsx, xls, rtf, zip, text files (e.g. html, xml, txt) and Open Office 2 documents. It can additionally search pdf files when the pdftotext binary is installed. (It's part of the poppler package.) We provide two versions of Find_SSNs: One that searchs pdfs and another version that doesn't search pdfs (in case you can't install the poppler package).

(unless you are using the version of Find_SSNs with pdf support disabled)Reducing False Positives:Find_SSNs uses a few innovative methods to reduce false positives, but it *will* still find some false positives when it scans your computer.    We've found that the best way to reduce the number of false positives is to only scan locations on the servers that could hold PII information. For example, /home, /fileshare, etc...    We've included the false positives that Find_SSNs finds on a full scan of a default install of RHEL5 and Solaris 10 in the Find_SSNs packages in the directory named &quot;default_false_positives&quot;.Scanning:For the full documentation on Find_SSNs, please refer to the Find_SSNs official documentation, located here: http://security.vt.edu/software/Find_SSNs/find_ssns_referance_manual.html. Scanning your filesystem(s) for files that contain SSN or CC #'s is the same across all Unix/Linux boxes.

    "question": "Voice over IP (VoIP) Service",
    "answer": "&nbsp;VoIP Basics&nbsp;Voice Over IP (Internet Protocol) is the technology of transporting voice communications over IP networks.The current UH Manoa telephone system relies on physical wires that directly connect your handset to a port on the UH Manoa telephone switch at Bilger Addition. A separate data network connects the computer to switches and routers in the building basement, which is then connected to the UHNet via fiber cabling. This separation of voice and data networks will change with the implementation of VoIP.With VoIP, voice communications run as IP Packets within the data network.&nbsp; A separate voice network is no longer needed.The handset acts as a normal telephone handset - the only apparent difference is that it connects to the data side of the datajack via standard Ethernet cabling and has an IP address. Existing phone numbers, five-digit dialing and multiple line appearances will be kept with no changes.ITS managed Power over Ethernet (PoE) switches in the building wiring closets will provide power to the IP Phones through the Ethernet cable and will continue to power the phones for at least 15-20 minutes during a power outage.&nbsp;Handsets&nbsp;VoIP Handsets behave identically to the currently installed handsets. One change would be that basic analog handsets will be upgraded to single line digital display VoIP handsets. &nbsp;For more information about the phone sets and user guides, go to &nbsp;www.hawaii.edu/askus/1405&nbsp;The handsets are powered via Ethernet, commonly referred to as Power over Ethernet, or PoE (802.3af). The Ethernet switches in the wiring closets will sense if a device is capable of utilizing PoE and only after it determines that it is, will power be sent. This delay and check protects equipment that is not PoE aware.&nbsp; Accidentally connecting a computer or other non PoE device directly to the datajack will not cause any damage.As much as possible, ITS will disconnect the Ethernet cable from the computer in the office, connect it to the IP Phone and then run a cable from the IP Phone&rsquo;s PC port to the computer.Analog LinesCurrent analog handsets will be replaced with a single line IP Phone. Analog lines for faxes, modems, conference phones, etc. will be provided over the IP network through analog gateways located in the main telecom closet in each building - thus no changes will be necessary for these devices.&nbsp; Short downtimes will be required as jumpers are moved to the new equipment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Avaya Voice Mail&nbsp; The new Avaya voicemail system provides the following key features:    Unified messaging - Voice messages can be forwarded to your email mailbox    Reach me - Incoming calls can be forwarded up to three numbers when there is no answer to the phone *    Notify me - Text message, phone call, &nbsp;and/or email notification can be configured when a new voice mail message is received ** Contact ITS at 956-6033 if you are interested in using these options.&nbsp; For more information, see the FAQ at www.hawaii.edu/askus/1358Quick Reference Guide: &nbsp; Avaya Aura Messaging (voice mail) quick guide for Manoa&nbsp; or&nbsp; support.avaya.com/Libraries/Msg/60/user/en-US/QRG/Avaya Aura Messaing Web Interface User Guide : &nbsp;Avaya Aura User GuideNetwork DesignThe VoIP network, while running on the same physical network equipment as the existing data network, is completely separate and isolated.All IP Phones across campus will be on the VoIP network which utilizes private RFC1918 addresses. At no time is the VoIP network interconnected with the UHNet and thus the IP Phones cannot be reached via the Internet. No IP address changes will be required for computers, nor will any additional IP addresses from departmental allocations be used.The Ethernet switch port that the IP Phone connects to also provides access to the existing data network. The existing data network will be set &ldquo;untagged&rdquo; while the VoIP network will be &ldquo;tagged&rdquo;. Tagging refers to applying an 802.1Q or VLAN identifier to the Ethernet frame. The IP Phone will look at the &ldquo;tagged&rdquo; frame for voice communications and pass the &ldquo;untagged&rdquo; frame out its PC Port and onto the computer. As the data network is &ldquo;untagged&rdquo;, plugging a computer directly into the jack will continue to function as it does now.VoIP bandwidth for a typical phone call averages about 16 kilobits per second in both directions. &nbsp;Quality of Service (QoS) settings on all of the ITS switches from the building to the UHNet core will ensure that voice traffic is prioritized over any other traffic - thus even if an Ethernet port is fully utilized, the phone will ring and will be able to place a call with no effect to the sound quality.As the IP Phones are powered by PoE Ethernet switches from a central location (wiring closets per floor), ITS will be able to provide at minimum a 15-20 minute runtime for the IP Phones in the event of a power outage. Certain locations may have longer run times due to the smaller number of switches and phones. Once UPS power is exhausted at any point throughout the network, IP Phones will not function.Typical Network Diagram&nbsp;FAQsWhy are we switching to IP Phones?Moving the phones towards a network based system opens up new services to our users and provides cost savings for the University. &nbsp;Will there be any phone outages?For IP Phone handsets there will be no outages for the users. Until the old handset is removed, it will continue to function.Analog lines to faxes and conference phones will incur an outage of approximately 30 minutes as jumpers are moved at the building and at Bilger Addition.If they wish, users may use the ethernet port on their IP phone to connect their computer and free up the ethernet port on the Telecom outlet for other devices.Will our network have to change?No. Addition of the IP Phone will be transparent to your network. The existing data network that is currently coming out of the datajack will now show up on the PC Port of the IP Phone. No readdressing of any computers is necessary.Will ITS use up my IP address allocation?No. The IP Phones uses RFC1918 private address space that is completely independent of your allocation. You will not see the IP phones on your network.Will the Phones work in a power outage?Yes - ITS will power the phones from the wiring closets with Power over Ethernet switches that are UPS protected. ITS estimates that a typical runtime for the UPS will be at least 15-20 minutes. Some locations may run for a longer period of time.Will my fax machines and conference phones work?Yes. These extensions and jack numbers will be identified and analog service will be provided. &nbsp;These devices will incur an outage of approximately 30 minutes as jumpers are moved to the new cabling.&nbsp;&nbsp;"

    "question": "How can a UH department license iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch apps for UH-owned devices?",
    "answer": "UH departments can use a Departmental UH Username and the associated email address to download and purchase apps for departmental iOS devices (iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch) through the App Store. Ownership for apps downloaded through the App Store is tied to the specific Apple ID used to download and purchase the app, so a departmental UH email account can be setup as an Apple ID and used to download and purchase apps with departmental funds using a P-Card.iOS devices have the ability to support multiple Apple IDs so, in theory, a department can download and purchase apps for a UH-owned device with department funds while the primary user could use their own Apple ID to download and purchase apps with personal funds which they would own but could use on the device.To sign in with an Apple ID or switch between Apple IDs on your iOS device:    Touch Settings    Touch Store    Touch the Apple ID that is already signed in. (If no account is signed in, skip to #5.)    Touch Sign Out    Touch Sign In    Touch Use Exisiting Apple ID,&nbsp;if the Apple ID was already created. If the Apple ID was not yet created with the UH departmental email address, touch Create New Apple ID and follow the instructions&nbsp;to setup a new Apple ID with your UH departmental email address.    The next screen should prompt you for your username and password for your Apple ID. Enter that information and touch OK.    You should now be logged into the Store.Please note that Automatic Downloads should be turned OFF. You can find these settings above your Apple ID in the Store settings menu. Turning any of those settings on will lock the iOS device to the current ID for 90 days.If you need to request a Departmental UH Username to use as an Apple ID, please visit http://www.hawaii.edu/its/id/."

    "question": "Securing Network Printers and Multi-Function Devices",
    "answer": "Network Printers and Multi-Function Devices (MFD) are common in offices because they provide the ability to copy, print, scan, and fax from one central machine that is shared by many.  The MFD's typically store information and are connected to the network, therefore security controls need to be enforced to protect the information being printed, copied, scanned, faxed, etc.  UH policy EP 2.214 Security and Protection of Sensitive Information defines security requirements when MFD's are used for protected data.The following is a list of best practices that should be followed to harden Network Printers and MFD's.  This checklist is a guideline since the management interfaces for MFD's vary, so refer to the MFD's documentation or the vendor to ensure you implement the security controls available for the various models.    Change default Administrator password - Change the default passwords and SNMP community strings to complex passwords.  If possible the passwords should be changed at least annually.    Disable unneeded management protocols - Disable unused network protocols.  TCP/IP is necessary for the network device with restrictions.  SMTP, SNMP V3 and HTTPS  may be used for device management, updates, monitoring, and communications.  Other protocols provide potential for unauthorized access or compromise so they should be disabled if possible.    Assign a Static or Fixed IP - Network printers and MFD's should have a static or fixed IP.  This will provide protection in the event that the DNS cache is poisoned; print files will not be able to be redirected.    IP Filtering - If possible, restrict access to the MFD by allowing access to a specific set or range of IP Addresses.    Updates - To protect the network printer or MFD from known security vulnerabilities the firmware needs to be kept up to date.  To ensure that updates are applied in a timely manner the MFD Administrator should request automatic update notifications if the manufacturer offers them.  The MFD Administrator should also check for patches available to mitigate the vulnerabilities. Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Click on 'Search CVE List' and enter your MFD or printer manufacturer/model.    Physical Security - If there is a hard drive in the MFD, physical access to the device should be restricted / secured to prevent unauthorized access / removal of the hard drive.    Data Security - If there is a hard drive in the MFD, enable encryption for data stored and data transmitted to and from the device.  The recommended encryption algorithm is Advanced Encryption Standard (AES 128-bit).  Also enable immediate and scheduled image overwrite to erase data from the hard drive and non-volatile storage.  Check the manufacturer's technical specifications to ensure the hard drive can be encrypted.    Authentication - Enable network authentication restricting Users access to authorized services and ensure Users can not access the MFD global configuration.    Secure Printing - If available, enable the secure printing option that holds the print job until the owner enters a pin to release the document.    Logging - Enable logging to capture job activity, User access, fax logging, configuration changes, etc.  The logs are necessary to identify malicious activity and in the event of a security incident, logs can assist with prosecution.  Logs should be reviewed for irregular activity that may be considered a security incident, for example transmitting large amounts of data after regular business hours or many failed log on attempts in a short amount of time."

    "question": "Sensitive Information Paper Document Disposal",
    "answer": "Sensitive information is defined in UH Policy E2.214 and includes information like social security number, student records, health information, personal financial information, drivers license numbers, etc. If sensitive UH information is disclosed it may be classified as a breach and require legal action. &nbsp;Breaches cause possible harm to the affected individuals, UH reputation, and legal fees and fines.The major focus of document disposal is related to digital information disposal such as hard drives, flash drives, CD's, and digital files. &nbsp;However, paper documents with sensitive information tossed in the trash can be retrieved by a dumpster diver and is legal if the dumpster is in a public place. &nbsp;Dumpster diving is the act of sifting through a persons or businesses trash looking for discarded items that can be reused. &nbsp;Dumpster diving does not sound like a desirable activity, but it is a highly effective way for attackers to gather sensitive information that can be used by the attacker for monetary gain.Dumpster diving is only one example of exposing sensitive informaiton that has been discarded. &nbsp;Sensitive papers left out in the open can be seen and retrieved by attackers. &nbsp;Papers may accidentally be left in a public place, fly out of a vehicle, or be used as scratch paper. &nbsp;In all of these examples you are putting your personal information or your business information at risk.So what should you do? &nbsp;First of all, limiting and reducing the amount of sensitive information printed will reduce the risk of accidental disclosure. &nbsp;Secondly, documents with sensitive information should be stored in a secure area and accessible by only those with a need to view the information. &nbsp;Documents should be stored in a locked file cabinet, locked storage room, or other secure area. &nbsp;Finally, when it comes time to dispose of the documents they should be shredded prior to disposal. &nbsp;The best method for shredding sensitive information is using a cross-cut shredder that shreds the paper small enough so the data can not be reconstructed. &nbsp;Using a strip-cut shredder is not secure if someone wants to reconstruct the information. &nbsp;For an example of how strip cut documents can be reconstructed see the article on Back Together Again.

    "question": "Malware - What is it and Steps to Protect your Computer",
    "answer": "Malware &ndash; What is it and how is it distributed?(Malicious software)&nbsp;Malware is a generic term used to describe various types of malicious software designed to remotely exploit an electronic device without your knowledge and in most cases for financial gain.&nbsp; There are numerous types of malware to name a few; viruses, worms, Trojans, keystroke loggers, spyware, and adware.&nbsp; The increase in types of mobile devices, cloud computing, and social networks have increased the landscape for malware attacks.&nbsp; Malware is constantly evolving and gets increasingly sophisticated making it more difficult to identify and contain.&nbsp;Some types of malware require some level of user interaction to initiate the infection process such as clicking on a web link in an e-mail, opening an executable file attached to an e-mail or visiting a website where malware is hosted.&nbsp;Check out the Ask Us article on some malware definitions Differences Between a Virus, Worm, and Trojan Horse.&nbsp;A keystroke logger is a hidden program on your computer that will record each key pressed on your keyboard and transmits or saves the information for the attacker.&nbsp; The attackers are typically collecting login information including passwords, credit card information and any information they can use for financial gain.&nbsp;Spyware is another type of software program installed on your computer without your knowledge.&nbsp; It collects information on your Internet surfing activity.&nbsp; The information is then used for marketing purposes or fraud.&nbsp; The information can be used maliciously to collect login and financial information typed on the keyboard.&nbsp;Adware is embedded in software you download for free or at a low cost.&nbsp; The intention is to display advertisements when you access the software.&nbsp; Adware can also include the same properties as spyware.&nbsp;E-mail attachments and links are popular methods for attackers to install malware on computers.    A file attached to e-mail may have malware embedded in it, so when the file is opened the malware is released.&nbsp;    A malicious link in e-mail can activate a malware program embedded in the e-mail message or it may open a Web page similar to the correct page, but with malware embedded in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;How do I protect my computer from Malware?&nbsp;The first thing you must do is build a defense against malware by installing Anti-virus and Anti-spyware software and keep it up to date Anti-Spyware Solution for Your PC.&nbsp; Also, use a personal firewall to block unwanted connections to your computer when connected to the Internet.&nbsp; This Ask Us article explains Personal Firewalls.&nbsp; Keep your computers operating system and software up to date with the latest patches.&nbsp; The rest is up to you to use safe Internet browsing practices.&nbsp;Safe browsing practices:    Use strong passwords    Never store logon information    Keep your web browser up to date    If you provide personal information:            Make sure the site is legitimate and trustworthy        Verify the site is encrypting your information (HTTPS) at the beginning of the URL        Clear your cookies and cache refer to Ask Us articles Cookies &amp; Cache            Do not click on links unless you know they are legitimate    Be wary of Internet downloads, innocent looking software or streaming media could contain malicious malware    Do not click on links or attachments in e-mails unless you can verify its authenticityThe University of Hawaii (UH) Information Technology Services (ITS) provides software, services, and technical support to protect the UH community against computer viruses and security threats.&nbsp; Refer to the Ask Us article for detailed installation information &nbsp;UH Computer Virus and Threat Information &nbsp;&nbsp;What do I do if I think my computer is infected?&nbsp;Refer to the Ask Us article Infected Computer AskUs 562&nbsp;for&nbsp;some information on what to do if your Anti Virus program identifies a virus and other signs that may indicate your computer has been compromised.&nbsp;Attackers also use e-mail to try to extract your personal information that they will use for financial gain.&nbsp; These types of attacks are called &ldquo;Phishing&rdquo;. &nbsp;This Ask Us article explains what Phishing is and how to identify it.

    "question": "Physical Device Security",
    "answer": "The security of your data is only as good as the amount of physical access someone has to it. Most common security measures such as firewalls and passwords will be rendered useless if someone gains physical access to your device. With laptops getting smaller and lighter and with the increase in use of mobile devices like iPads, iPhones, and Android devices it is easier than ever to steal valuable personal and business related data. Below are some ways to help in safeguarding your devices from being stolen, and if they are stolen to make sure no one can access your data.There are many different ways to secure your computer from physical locks to cameras that take pictures of someone that is trying to steal your computer. Some of these resources are free and some can be purchased on a subscription basis.Computer LocksThere are many kinds of physical locks you can choose from. These locks used to only be necessary for laptops, but now with the  small form factor of computers such as the iMac, you should consider  these locks for any desktop that is not in a secure location. You can choose from key or combination locks for devices that are moved around often. For some examples of laptop locks see www.kensington.com/kensington/us/us/s/1479/laptop-locks.aspx. The important part of using a laptop lock is ensuring that you secure it to something&nbsp; like a desk leg that cannot be easily lifted. You should also ensure that the lock you purchase is compatible with your device.Mobile DevicesIt is important to note that physical locks are also available for a variety of mobile devices such as the iPad, iPhone and Android devices. However, since these devices might not be convenient to physically lock, having a passcode is your first line of defense in securing your mobile device. Some devices allow you to set the passcode to wipe the device after a certain amount of incorrect attempts to enter the pin.Computer AlarmsAnother way to protect your laptop from getting stolen would be to install an alarm. This alarm would work similar to a car alarm and would sound a loud noise if your device was in danger of being stolen. You can get these for both Mac's and PC's and they can be set up with either a physical device or software.LAlarm (Windows only software) Free for personal use: www.lalarm.comLaptop security alarms example: www.amazon.com/Belkin-F5L013-Laptop-Security-Alarm/dp/B000RPVHDCLaptop Security CamsLaptop security cameras work on motion sensors and will either upload pictures to a website or email the pictures to you when the motion sensor is activated. This solution should be used along with a physical lock.Yawcam for Windows: www.yawcam.com/Gawker for Mac: gawker.sourceforge.net/Gawker.htmlAdditional Laptop protection strategies can be found in AskUs article 927.Device LocatorsThere are services available for mobile devices that will use the GPS locator to allow you to track them. This service requires that you have location services turned on for your device. If your device is stolen you can log onto a website and track the location of where it is and any movement. Some of these services allow you to send messages or to remotely wipe all of the data on your device as long as it is turned on and has a connection to the GPS.Find My iPhone: Free for Mac users and works in conjunction with iCloud. Can be used for iPhone, iPad, iTouch or your Mac. http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/find-my-iphone/id376101648?mt=8Lojack: Subscription based commercial product for Windows. www.lojack.com/pages/laptop.aspxPrey: Open Source for multi platforms. preyproject.com/Engraving As unappealing as it may be, physically engraving your name, University inventory number, or other very visible identifying information is a detterent to theft.&nbsp; It makes it difficult to resell the stolen computer.Physical Positioning of the DeviceIdeally, the computer or other desirable electronic device should be positioned out of the line of sight of windows and doors.&nbsp; If the device is in plain view of window or door, the thief can easily see it when doing a reconnaisance.&nbsp; Additionally, do not leave the screen on at night as the glow of the screen in a dark room is a dead giveaway."

For example, John Doe's current email address is jdoe@hawaii.edu. With first.last, John's email alias could be john.doe@hawaii.edu. It is also a more definitive way of identifying yourself to another colleague where they might know your first and last name, but not your eight character email name. This is an optional service being offered to faculty and staff./tHow do I request a first.last email alias?/tStaff or Faculty may request a first.last by logging in at https://www.hawaii.edu/username with your UH Username and password. After logging in, click on the &quot;first.last Email Alias&quot; link and follow the instructions there./tMay I pick any name for my first.last email alias?/tYou may have only one first.last email alias active at any one time. The first.last email alias should be closely related to your full name. The following are guidelines for selecting your first.last email alias:    first.last    first.last.generation    first.m.last    first.m.last.generation    first.middle.last    first.middle.last.generation    middle.last    middle.last.generationYour first.last email alias may only use alphabets (a-z), dash and/or period. The first.last email alias is not case-sensitive so Jane.Doe@hawaii.edu is the same as jane.doe@hawaii.edu. The &quot;last&quot; part of your selected first.last email alias must reflect your legal last name on record, so if your last name is Doe, Doe must be the &quot;last&quot; part of your first.last email alias. Offensive language will not be allowed in your first.last email alias even if it spells out your name. Alternative first.last email alias combinations can be considered.Name Changes and First.Last AliasIf your name has changed, you have the option to switch from the first.last email alias that was based on your previous name, and activate a new first.last email alias based on your new name. For example, Jane Doe has Jane.Doe@hawaii.edu but they have changed their name to Jane Smith. They can choose to activate Jane.Smith@hawaii.edu (if it is available) and their Jane.Doe@hawaii.edu alias would be removed.Additional AssistanceIf you have any questions, or run into any problems regarding your UH Username, feel free to call the ITS Help Desk at (808) 956-8883 or toll-free from neighbor islands at (800) 558-2669 for assistance./tWhat will happen to my first.last email alias when I leave UH?/tWhen you leave UH, your first.last email alias will be removed at the end of your grace period, unless you enroll in 'Ohana online services.

Check if others can use it &ndash; If the device is still usable after securely erasing it, issue an internal email or memo within the department to see if anyone has use for the unwanted equipment; if not, then advertise it as available on the UH Electronic Swap Meet, where surplus materials and equipment can be transferred between departments within UH. The Swap Meet also contains a section for listing of Wanted Items.    Verify Inventory &ndash; Prior to disposal of ewaste, contact department Administrative Officers (AO) or Fiscal Officers (FO) who may be responsible for the inventory of equipment; verification of ownership via the serial number or State Decal number on the equipment may be required.    Determine Best Disposal/Recycling Method &ndash; Always follow other established procedures for transfer or disposal of UH-owned equipment outlined in the AskUs article Disposal Guidelines for Unused UH Computer Equipment.A United Nations report suggests that production of waste electrical and electronic equipment could rise by as much as 500% over the next decade. According to a Waste Electrical and Electronical Equipment (WEEE) forum, 2021 had a total of an estimated 57.4 million tonnes of ewaste.&nbsp;Following these best practices is a positive step in slowing the impact that the use of electronics and their recycling will have on Hawaii&rsquo;s ecosystem."

    "question": "Secure Document Destruction",
    "answer": "When disposing of paper documents that contain sensitive information, it is best to ensure that they are securely destroyed by shredding. When storing and transporting documents to be shredded, there are some important steps you can take to ensure that none of the documents are misplaced or disposed of incorrectly. See www.hawaii.edu/calendar/manoa/2012/05/31/18544.html for information related to past shred days.Determining What Needs to Be Securely DestroyedDocuments that contain any of the following sensitive information should be shredded securely and not recycled or thrown in the garbage. See www.hawaii.edu/askus/1266 for more information.1) Student records, including anything protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)2) Health information, including anything covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)3) Personal financial information such as credit card numbers, bank account information, debit card numbers, etc.4) Job applicant records (names, transcripts, etc.)5) Social Security Numbers6) Dates of birth7) Private home addresses and phone numbers8) Driver license numbers and State ID Card numbers9) Access codes, passwords and PINs for online information systems10) Answers to &quot;security questions&quot; such as &quot;what is the name of your favorite pet?&quot;11) Confidential information subject to attorney-client privilege12) Detailed information about security systems (physical and/or network)13) Confidential salary information14) Information made confidential by a collective bargaining agreementStoring Sensitive Documents for ShreddingWhen you determine that you have a document that needs to be securely shredded, it is best to do so immediately. If you do not have that option or must store the documents for a period of time until they are shredded, there are precautions you can take to ensure the information is kept secure.1) Store the documents in a location away from trash or recycling so it is not confused with material that can be placed in the garbage or recycling container.2) Secure the box or container that the documents are held in. Make sure it cannot be easily removed and is locked.3) Ensure that the chosen storage location is secure with locked doors and monitored access if possible.&nbsp;Transporting and Shredding of Sensitive DocumentsIf your shredder or shredding service is not located in the same location as where the documents are stored, it is important that the documents are transported securely to ensure no boxes get misplaced or lost along the way.Before shredding any documents:1) Depending on your shredder type, make sure no items that are not  allowed are mixed in with the paper. This can include, but is not  limited to:    Metal, Clamps    CD&rsquo;s, Floppy Disc    Cassette Tapes    Rubber Bands    Binders    Microfilm/X-Rays    Plastic Items&nbsp;2) For added security it is recommended to use a cross cut shredder that shreds the document into very small pieces.3) For an extra level of security, you can put the shredded pieces into separate bags.Electronic Files with Sensitive InformationFor information on securely deleting electronic information containing sensitive information see www.hawaii.edu/askus/706.&nbsp;"

    "question": "Windows XP End of Life (EOL)",
    "answer": "Microsoft ends support for Windows XP and Office 2003 on April 8, 2014. What does this mean? Microsoft will no longer provide security updates or technical support for Windows XP and Office 2003. Computers running unsupported software have increased risk of cyber security threats, such as malicious attacks and data loss.What should I do?If you have not already replaced your Windows XP machines (or upgraded to a newer operating system -- for newer hardware only), you are strongly encouraged to take action as soon as possible. ITS recommendations are posted at http://www.hawaii.edu/technews/notice.php?id=245108If you have questions or need assistance, please contact the ITS Help Desk at 956-8883, email help@hawaii.edu or call toll free from the neighbor islands (800) 558-2669.The US-CERT has also posted an Alert TA14-069A: &nbsp; https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA14-069A-0If ITS detects a compromised Windows XP system, it may be blocked permanently until the operating system is upgraded.&nbsp;If you absolutely MUST RUN Windows XP:    Limit use of the computer to non confidential purposes - no credit card processing, no access to student or employee records, etc. unless absolutely necessary (e.g. part of your job responsibilities).    If you must access confidential/sensitive information, do not browse to non-work related web sites, click on links in unsolicited emails, etc.&nbsp; Make sure your computer does not get infected/compromised.    US-CERT recommends that you get rid of Internet Explorer (because it will no longer get patches). Install an alternative, current browser and make it the default. Windows XP comes with Internet Explorer but it only supports up to IE 8, making the security features of later versions unavailable.    If the machine is being used to control laboratory equipment, it should not be used for routine email and web surfing.    Air-gap or isolate on separate networks the XP devices in order to protect more modern machines from being attacked by compromised XP devices; you might consider leaving XP devices off the network completely if network and/or Internet access is not needed.    Install the final Windows XP update so machines start their unsupported lives protected from the latest known vulnerabilities.    Fully patch Microsoft Office if it&rsquo;s on the machine to reduce the chances of it compromising the device.    Uninstall unused third-party software. The older it is, the more likely it is to be vulnerable.    Consider disabling or uninstalling browser plugins for third-party software, and set the browser to ask what to do with PDFs, etc., rather than opening them by default.    Install up-to-date firewalls and anti-virus software.    Keep the computer on a trusted network behind a NAT router, which acts as a hardware firewall.Related Links    ITS New Computer Purchase Recommendations    Free Antivirus Software for UH community&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional information from Microsoft:http://blogs.msdn.com/b/securitytipstalk/archive/2014/04/08/get-security-updates-for-april-2014.aspx&nbsp;&quot;Support for Windows XP has endedMicrosoft has provided support for Windows XP for the past 12 years. But the time has come for us, along with our hardware and software partners, to invest our resources toward supporting more recent technologies so that we can continue to deliver great new experiences.As a result, technical assistance for Windows XP will no longer be available, including automatic updates that help protect your PC. Microsoft will also stop providing Microsoft Security Essentials for download on Windows XP on this date. (If you already have Microsoft Security Essentials installed, you will continue to receive antimalware signature updates for a limited time, but this does not mean that your PC will be secure because Microsoft will no longer provide security updates to help protect your PC.)&quot;More information about the risks if you continue to use Windows XP:http://blogs.technet.com/b/security/archive/2014/03/24/cyber-threats-to-windows-xp-and-guidance-for-small-businesses-and-individual-consumers.aspx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"

    "question": "Heartbleed OpenSSL Vulnerability Information",
    "answer": "(This information is being updated frequently - please check back often for any updates.)A major security vulnerability named Heartbleed&nbsp;was disclosed on April 7, 2014.&nbsp;  This vulnerability affects many websites on the Internet that use OpenSSL to encrypt  webpages (pages that start with https).&nbsp; SSL, or  secure socket layer, is an Internet protocol which is designed to encrypt traffic over the Internet to hide sensitive information from prying eyes.  SSL is often used to encrypt passwords that are used to securely access services offered through a website.This OpenSSL security issue allows the stealing  of information protected by SSL by revealing the private keys that protect the  confidentiality of the information.&nbsp; Sites affected by the security vulnerability  can have login credentials stolen as well as other data that would normally be  protected by an encrypted SSL connection.&nbsp; In addition, once an attacker has the private key  for a particular website, they can use the key to decrypt traffic previously sent to  the server prior to the bug being disclosed.It is important to note that only specific versions of OpenSSL are vulnerable.  More detailed information  about Heartbleed can be found at:  http://heartbleed.comThe Washington Post offered a   reasonable summary of this vulnerability and impact across the Internet.&nbsp;So what does this mean to you?  Do I need to change my UH username password?NEW! as of 4/14/2014, 2:30pmITS has assessed the impact of the vulnerability for the primary UH services. The list of services and the impact of the Heartbleed bug  is available at: https://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/heartbleed/index.phpYou will need to login with your UH username and password to view the page.Please note that individual campus or departmental applications are not listed here.  Check with your IT support staff for local service/application information.A few UH services were affected by the Heartbleed vulnerability.  Users of those services will be contacted directly to change their passwords.You may also be notified by your campus or department to change your UH password if it may have been exposed through their server or service.&nbsp;What about my personal accounts such as Facebook, Twitter, etc.?CNET is maintaining a list of the top 100 web sites and their status available at:  http://www.cnet.com/how-to/which-sites-have-patched-the-heartbleed-bug/If you logged-in to any website listed as vulnerable or if you have been notified by the service, you  should change your password AFTER the website has been fixed. If you are not sure if a site was vulnerable,  or if it has been fixed, you can check the website using the Heartbleed test site:  http://filippo.io/Heartbleed/IMPORTANT! You should NOT use your UH username and password to login to any non-UH website!  If you did use your UH credentials to login to any vulnerable website, you should change your UH password using  the UH One-Step Password Change page:  https://www.hawaii.edu/username/userprefs/password_only.cgiYou may need to reset your UH password more than once if you used your UH credentials on   websites that are vulnerable AND used your new/reset password on a vulnerable website that has not yet been fixed.Be on the alert for phishing attempts!Watch for fraudulent email claiming to be from UH or other companies with which you do business.  Criminals will use this as an opportunity to create targeted phishing email messages to trick people into  divulging their passwords.  Information Technology Services (ITS) will NEVER ask for your password in an unsolicited  email. Be on the lookout for  sites that purport to tell you whether your site or your information has been compromised, especially if  they demand personal details, login credentials, or payment.&nbsp;For System Administrators:If you are a system administrator with OpenSSL installed, please see:  http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1575  for more information. &nbsp;Last updated:  April 14, 2014 02:30 PM HST &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"

OpenSSL  provides communication security and privacy over the Internet for many  applications, including web, email, instant messaging (IM) and some  virtual private networks (VPNs).What is the risk?This bug has left large amounts of  sensitive data exposed to attackers. Exploitation of the Heartbleed bug  leaves no trace, and thus requires everyone to take this exposure  seriously. In a worst-case scenario, leaked encryption keys  allow an attacker to decrypt traffic, both current and past, to the  protected services. An attacker may also impersonate the service at  will.Read the full story online: http://heartbleed.com/&nbsp;If you have servers that are vulnerable to this attack, please remediate as quickly as possible following these steps:    Update the OpenSSL code as required    Replace the public/private keys and associated SSL/TLS certificate associated with that server/those servers, revoking the earlier (now potentially compromised) SSL/TLS certificate(s).    Review the configuration of each SSL/TLS server using:&nbsp; https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/ evaluation page (note that you can check the box &quot;Do not show the results on the boards&quot; should you desire to do so).    As part of reviewing those results, you may want to consider enabling ciphers that support Forward Secrecy (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy for basic background).&nbsp; Please note that enabling this feature may have unintended consequences (such breaking your application).    If the server was used to login to access secure services and passwords may have been exposed, you may need to notify your users to change their passwords.If you cannot remediate your server and it is being used to access sensitive information, ITS may block access to the server until it can be remediated.Additional references:http://threatpost.com/openssl-fixes-tls-vulnerability/105300http://www.zdnet.com/heartbleed-serious-openssl-zero-day-vulnerability-revealed-7000028166/http://www.itnews.com.au/News/382068,serious-openssl-bug-renders-websites-wide-open.aspxhttp://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-2165-1/https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0376.htmlhttp://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos-announce/2014-April/020249.htmlhttps://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/announce/2014-April/003205.html&nbsp;&nbsp;"

    "question": "Avoiding Phishing Voice and Emails Scams",
    "answer": "&nbsp;Here are some tips to help you avoid being a victim of phone and email phishing scams:     UH will NEVER ask for your credentials, including password verification, via an UNSOLICITED email or phone call.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any UNSOLICITED email or voicemail requesting you to do so should be treated as a potential phishing attack.    If you receive a call from the IRS, local police agency, or other agency claiming that you owe money, hang up the phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are unsure of whether or not the call was legitimate, you can call the number back at the agency's public phone number that you acquired from a legitimate source.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Be aware of &ldquo;spoofing,&rdquo; a practice in which a person can change the phone number that appears on your caller ID.&nbsp;&nbsp;A call may look as if it is coming from a police agency, even when it isn&rsquo;t (spoofing is also used in email scams).    Keep your credit card, checking account, and Social Security numbers to yourself. Don't tell them to callers you don't know &mdash; even if they ask you to &ldquo;confirm&rdquo; this information. That's a trick.    If you receive a &ldquo;special offer,&rdquo; research it with your&nbsp;consumer protection agency or state Attorney General&rsquo;s office&nbsp;before you agree to send money.    Beware of offers to &ldquo;help&rdquo; you&nbsp;recover money&nbsp;you have already lost. Callers that say they are law enforcement officers who will help you get your money back &ldquo;for a fee&rdquo; are scammers.    UH will never ask you to modify your inbox or adapt security measures via an email link. Any email requesting you to do so should be treated as a potential phishing attack.    If you receive an email from an unrecognized source, please exercise caution in dealing with its content. Do not open attachments unless you know it is safe to do so.    If you receive an email, either from an external or internal contact that you suspect may be a phishing attempt, please notify Information Technology Services at:&nbsp;phishing@hawaii.edu    Save any suspicious emails or phone messages to report to your local law enforcement agency.    If you feel that you have been a victim of fraud, please report it to your local police department.    &nbsp;Additional information about Phishing at UH can be found in:&nbsp; http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/966"

Core services include:    Gmail    Calendar    Drive    Groups (UH-only account collaboration)    Sites    Contacts    Classroom    Hangouts (classic)    Chat    Meet    Keep    Google Chrome SyncConsumer Apps include applications&nbsp;which are governed by either Google's general Terms of Services or by app-specific terms. All of the Consumer Apps fall under ITS &quot;best effort&quot; support, as described in the&nbsp;ITS Computer Support Policy.The list of Consumer Apps will vary, as Google adds new Apps or retires Apps or as demand for existing Apps drives a change to our inventory.

Please carefully weigh the pros and cons before turning on the Consumer Apps.Why can't I opt-in to Consumer Apps?Google@UH Consumer Apps have certain restrictions that may prevent you from opting in. One such restriction is that individuals under the age of 18 are unfortunately unable to opt-in to Google@UH Consumer Apps. If you need access to Google@UH Consumer Apps and are unable to opt in, please contact the ITS Help Desk by phone at (808) 956-8883 or by email at help@hawaii.edu. They can provide you with more information, as well as steps you can take to gain access to these apps.What happens after you turn on Consumer Apps for your Google@UH account?After turning on the Consumer Apps, the first time you log in to your Google@UH account to access any Core App or Consumer App, you must agree to Google's Terms of Service (TOS) and Privacy Policy before you can proceed. Your use and access of the Core Apps will continue to be governed under the terms of UH's master agreement with Google, even after you turn on Consumer Apps.Please note that some Google@UH Consumer Apps, such as Google Currents, have age restrictions that are handled separately from the overall Google@UH Consumer Apps restrictions. If you meet the requirements to opt into Google@UH Consumer Apps, you should be able to access these individual apps. However, when creating a profile in apps like Google Currents, you will be prompted to input an age. Inputting an age that does not meet Google Currents' age requirements will lock you out of your Google@UH account, including all Core Apps. If this happens, please contact the ITS Help Desk.Why would you want to opt-in to the Consumer Apps with your Google@UH account?Mainly, it's for data consolidation, convenience, and extended utility of your Google@UH account.How do the Google@UH Terms of Service differ from the Consumer Apps Terms of Service, besides &quot;no ads&quot;?The primary differences are 1) Google's Terms of Service gives Google the &quot;license to use&quot; your data from those Consumer Apps and 2) you, not UH, would be responsible for any legal disputes regarding your data or use of Google's services. The UH Google Agreement does not specify an allowance for a &quot;license to use&quot; your data provided to or through any of the Core Apps.Are there any privacy or security implications with turning on Consumer Apps?Yes, whenever you upload, submit, send or receive content to or through a Consumer App, you are giving Google permission to use, host, store, reproduce, and modify, publish and distribute that content, although it does not provide to or grant Google any ownership interest in the content. If you use YouTube, you are granting Google and any user of YouTube permission to reproduce, distribute, display and perform your content in YouTube.Google collects, analyzes, and uses information you supply by or through using the Consumer Apps, which may include information on the devices you use, your actual location when using them, and the search queries inputted while using them. Please be aware that because you are allowing Google to use certain information, you may be deemed to have waived certain privacy rights you may have under other laws, such as Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), to keep the information private.Google's automated system will analyze your content to provide you with personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection.What is the difference between Google Groups (Core Apps) and Google Groups (Consumer Apps)?All members in Google Groups (Core Apps) must have UH Usernames. Members in Google Groups (Consumer Apps) may include users with non-UH accounts.Google Groups under the Core App will have an address structure like group-name-grp@hawaii.edu. Google Groups under the Consumer App will have an address structure like group-name@googlegroups.com.What happens when you have a personal Google account already using some of the Consumer Apps?  If you opt-in, is the existing &quot;personal&quot; data, considered &quot;belonging to UH&quot;?The data uploaded, submitted, or sent to a Consumer App via your personal account will remain linked to that account. Outside of sharing the data within the Consumer App from one account to the other, the data should be maintained independently from your Google@UH account data.What happens to Consumer Apps data when user leaves UH or when UH Username gets disabled/deprovisioned?For disabled accounts, Consumer Apps data remains within the Consumer App and linked to the account. The disabled account will not be able to access any Core App or Consumer App while disabled, so the data may not be available to the account until it is re-enabled.The data in the Consumer Apps would be permanently deleted when the Google@UH account is permanently deleted.If you share Consumer App data under your Google@UH account with other accounts, do the other accounts still have access after your Google@UH account is deprovisioned?Once your Google@UH account is deleted, all data linked to your account will be inaccessible. Prior to your account deprovisioning, you should ensure that any data which is still needed by other accounts is transferred to be linked/hosted to another active account. We are not able to recover inaccessible or deleted Consumer Apps data.What happens when you try to access a Consumer App with your Google@UH account but have not turned on the Consumer Apps?You will get an error message saying that your Google@UH account does not have access to the Consumer App, the Consumer App service is not available for your organization or similar error message.Sample error message for YouTubeSample error message for Google Groups (Consumer App)"

    "question": "Updating WordPress on Hosted Departmental Sites",
    "answer": "Setting Administration over SSLBefore starting any updates, the first thing you should do is setup 'Administration Over SSL' for your wordpress site.&nbsp; This is because if updates are done using http, your authentication information could be transmitted unencrypted and potentially be stolen. To do this, add the following line to your wp-config.php above the line:&nbsp; /* That's all, stop editing! Happy blogging. */define('FORCE_SSL_ADMIN', true);Note that your domain will need to be SSL enabled to use this setting so if you are using your own special subdomain (ex. program.campus.hawaii.edu, and https://program.campus.hawaii.edu does not work for you) you may need to buy a certificate&nbsp;for the domain you are using to securely update your site.Download SSH SFTP Updater Support PluginTo enable WordPress One-Click update for your site, you will first need to download the wordpress plugin SSH SFTP Updater Support. &nbsp;To get the plugin, click the download link at:&nbsp;https://wordpress.org/plugins/ssh-sftp-updater-support/&nbsp;. &nbsp;After downloading, uncompress the .zip file you receive and place the folder named &quot;ssh-sftp-updater-support&quot; somewhere in your computer's work area, for example the desktop.Upload Plugin to SiteNext, you need to upload this plugin to your site. &nbsp;Connect to webedit with your preferred sFTP client, you should have received your connection settings via email when your site was created. &nbsp;Go to your site's directory and upload the folder named &quot;ssh-sftp-updater-support&quot; from your work area to your site's wordpress plugin directory. &nbsp;To get to this directory, first go to your site's home directory, then look within your site's structure for a directory named /wp-content/plugins/. (ex. if your site is located at /1/mysite, the plugin directory would typically be located at /1/mysite/wp-content/plugins). &nbsp;Once there, upload the whole &quot;ssh-sftp-updater-support&quot; directory from your computer's work area to the &quot;plugins&quot; directory.Activate PluginAfter uploading, log into your wordpress site and click on Menu Item at the left named &quot;Plugins&quot;. &nbsp;Find the plugin named SSH SFTP Updater Support in the list and enable it by pressing the Activate link as shown below.Start UpdateAfter activation, go back to your Dashboard, and either click on the Menu Item &quot;Updates&quot;, or click on the link labeled &quot;Please update now&quot; to go to WordPress Updates. &nbsp;After the page loads, click the button named &quot;Update Now&quot; as shown below to begin the update process.On the Update Screen, first make sure your &quot;Connection Type&quot; at the bottom is set to SSH2. (webedit does not support FTP or FTPS connections)After that is set, please use the following settings:Hostname: webedit.its.hawaii.eduFTP/SSH Username: &lt;your  Username&gt;FTP/SSH Password: &lt;your password&gt; (note: your  email password, not your WordPress password)The Private Key setting should be left blank. &nbsp;After this, press the &quot;Proceed&quot; button at the bottom of your screen.Update Plugins / ThemesThis will begin the update process. &nbsp;A screen will describe what's being updated on your site, and when that is completed it will bring you back to your WordPress Dashboard. &nbsp;Make sure after you update WordPress, you go back to WordPress Updates, (Updates in the Left Menu, or a circular arrow icon with a number at the top of your screen) and update your Plugins and Themes as well. &nbsp;To do this, check the checkmark next to the plugins/themes that needs updating, then press the Update Plugins/Update Theme button. &nbsp;The plugin/theme update process will be similar to the wordpress update process you've just gone through.TroubleshootingIf the Auto-Update fails, and your site displays a message saying it is unavailable for scheduled maintenance, delete the .maintenance file from your site's home directory using your sFTP client and try again.Another common occurence in failed site updates is a configuration themes sometimes add to a site's wp-config.php file.&nbsp; The setting of FS_METHOD to 'direct' doesn't allow sites to update via sftp. To remedy this, comment out the line by adding two slashes '//' in front of the line, and start the update process again.&nbsp; After doing updates, remove the slashes as it may be needed by the theme to perform certain functions.<strong>Before:</strong>define ( FS_METHOD , 'direct' );<strong>After:</strong>//define ( FS_METHOD , 'direct' );<br type='_moz' />Should you continue to have issues updating, please contact the web group at web-support-l@lists.hawaii.edu&nbsp;with information about what step in the process is failing along with any error messages that appeared during the update process. &nbsp;Taking screenshots of the errors you run into is usually very helpful for us to help diagnose your problem.&nbsp;"

    "question": "Allowing less secure apps to access your account",
    "answer": "Google is looking to phase out less secure apps in 2024, users should move to more modern apps or setup app specific passwords for legacy applications.More information can be found at https://www.hawaii.edu/its/alerts/?t=4&amp;id=10100&nbsp;Google may block sign-in attempts from some apps or devices that do not use modern security standards. Since these apps and devices are easier to break into, blocking them helps keep your account safe.Some examples of apps that do not support the latest security standards include:    The Mail app on your iPhone or iPad with iOS 6 or below    The Mail app on your Windows phone preceding the 8.1 release    Some Desktop mail clients like Microsoft Outlook and Mozilla Thunderbird                 Mozilla Thunderbird 38.0.1 and newer support the latest security standards        No current version of Outlook supports the latest security standards        Change account access for&nbsp;less secure appsTo help keep Google Apps users' accounts secure, Google may block less secure apps from accessing Google Apps accounts. As a Google Apps user, you will see a &ldquo;Password incorrect&rdquo; error when trying to sign in. If this is the case, you have two options:    Upgrade to a more secure app that uses the most up to date security measures. All Google products, like Gmail, use the latest security measures.    Go to&nbsp;Allow less secure apps&nbsp;and choose &ldquo;Allow&rdquo; to let less secure apps access your Google account. We don't recommend this option because it may make it easier for someone to gain access to your account. But some cases where you still might want to allow apps access include:If you want to continue using an app you&rsquo;re familiar with. For example, if you have a Samsung phone and check your email messages with the app that came on the phone, you can choose &ldquo;Allow&rdquo; to continue using it."

As long as your mobile device has mobile network or wi-fi service, authentication requests can be pushed to your device via the Duo Mobile app.  You can download the Duo Mobile app to an iOS or Android device that meets the minimum requirements.                        iOS            Please see&nbsp;https://guide.duo.com/iphone&nbsp;for the supported version of iOS                            Android            Please see&nbsp;https://guide.duo.com/android&nbsp;for the supported version of Android            Once you have downloaded the Duo Mobile app and registered your mobile device, authentication requests will be &quot;pushed&quot; to your device through the Duo Mobile app.  You would then open the Duo Mobile app and tap on &quot;Approve&quot; or &quot;Deny&quot; to approve or deny the authentication request.Duo Passcode via the Duo Mobile AppThe Duo Mobile app can be used to generate a passcode that can be used to login. Passcodes can be generated without requiring internet access, and can be used even if your mobile device is in airplane mode or otherwise not connected to a WiFi or mobile network with internet access. This is a great option to use when traveling or when in areas where access to the internet might not be guaranteed.Phone CallYou can opt to authenticate via a phone call to a landline or mobile phone.  When it's time to authenticate, you will receive a call on your registered phone number.  You would then push &quot;1&quot; on your phone's keypad to authenticate, or push &quot;9&quot; to deny the authentication request.Regarding phone numbers beginning with &quot;+86&quot;ITS has been informed by Duo that due to recent telephony restrictions by the Chinese government, Duo is no longer able to authenticate by phone calls to users with +86 numbers.  If you have a +86 phone number registered in Duo, you will see the following notice:&nbsp;Other methods, such as Duo Push, SMS passcodes, or hard tokens will still work.  For more information, please refer to the following Duo knowledgebase article:https://help.duo.com/s/article/5001SMS PasscodesIf you do not have a smartphone, but you have a mobile phone with SMS/text messaging capabilities, you can use SMS passcodes to authenticate. When requested, a set of 10 passcodes will be sent to you as a text (SMS) message to your phone.  Each time you authenticate, you would use the next passcode in the sequence. After you've used all 10 passcodes, you can request a new set of 10 passcodes. You can also request a new set of 10 passcodes at any time. After you've requested a set of 10 passcodes, you can continue to use all of the passcodes in succession to authenticate even if your mobile device is no longer connected to mobile network.Yubikey Hard TokenA hard token (sometimes called an authentication or security token) is a hardware security device that is used to authorize a user.  UH provides Yubikey hard tokens for purchase.  The UH hard token is a usb device and must be inserted into your usb port to be used.  You would then touch the hard token anytime you wanted to authenticate.  If you do not have an available usb port, you cannot authenticate with the UH hard token. Hard tokens are not recommended and should be purchased only if you cannot use any of the other above means for authenticating.For information on purchasing a UH hard token, please visit https://www.hawaii.edu/sitelic/tokens/"

    "question": "Mobile Phishing",
    "answer": "People enjoy the convenience of their mobile device to read e-mail, check account balances, and pay bills. It&rsquo;s possible to become a victim to a phishing scam while on a mobile device. Sometimes it could be difficult to tell you are on a phishing site because the regular techniques to check for a phish on a mobile device is not apparent. For example, in the image below, it would appear that we are on PayPal&rsquo;s website to log in to our account. However, if we examine the URL closely, we see that we are on paypal-service-update-your-information. This is suspicious because although paypal is in the first part of the URL, we can't tell if it really is PayPal&rsquo;s site.&nbsp;  &nbsp;If you were to examine the full link, you would see that we are not on the paypal.com website, but instead on one controlled by the cybercriminal. When you are unsure or want to double check what page you're on, it's best to look at the full URL. See tip number 2 below to learn how. Checking the full URL is important because cybercriminals could make copies of popular websites to trick you into thinking that you are on the legitimate webpage.Another example of this is below. This one is trying to trick you into thinking that you are on Google&rsquo;s login page. The cybercriminal is relying on your mobile browser to hide the full URL of the page that you're on. In the first picture below, it would appear that we are on mail.google.com. However, if you tap into the URL bar to examine the URL closely, you will notice that you are really on com-secretsite's website which is shown in the second picture.&nbsp;   Tips    Before clicking on links, tap and hold the URL to view where it&rsquo;s going.  This ensures that the link is really taking you where it says it is. If the link looks suspicious, it&rsquo;s best to not click on the link. This technique works in web browsers and email apps.                    When on a web page, check the URL bar to ensure you are on the page you should be on.  Cybercriminals craft links to impersonate legitimate sites and services. If you're unsure if you&rsquo;re on the right page, tap in the address bar and swipe left to right to view the full URL. To verify the true website that you&rsquo;re on, look for the last period before the first forward slash. The words to the left and right of that period is the web site you are on.         For example, in the image below, the full URL is artsci.manoa.hawaii.edu/. The word to the left of the last period is hawaii, and to the right of the last period is edu and the first forward slash. We make the determination that it is &quot;hawaii.edu&quot; which is the official web site used by the University of Hawai&lsquo;i.

    "question": "Virtual Server: How to Access Your Virtual Server via VMware Console Access",
    "answer": "With the vSphere Web Client, you can access a virtual server's desktop by launching a console to the virtual server. From the console, you can perform activities in the virtual server such as configure operating system settings, run applications, monitor performance, and so on. Features will be different based on the permission level assigned to your account.&nbsp;You can also monitor the resources the virtual server uses from the console, but you  will not be able to modify the configuration of the virtual machine, such as changing RAM/vCPU or disk allocation.NOTE: The ITS VMware infrastructure has been updated to a more recent version of VMware vSphere, so the older vSphere &quot;thick&quot; Client no longer works, as some of our users in the past had used that. The current client is now the vSphere Web Client that you access from a web browser.Prerequisites    You must be a VM Hosting customer.    &nbsp;    You must be be listed as the technical contact for your VM.    &nbsp;    You must have an Enterprise VPN account.     &nbsp;    You will also need a Hawaii Domain account. This is a different account from your UH Username/@hawaii.edu account. This account is provided to you as part of the activation process for VM console access.    &nbsp;Procedure    As part of completing your console access request, your UH Username and Password will be activated for VPN access. Download and install the VPN client by following the instructions (ITS will email you that).    &nbsp;        On your web browser (Google Chrome appears to have the best experience), go to https://vcr02.hawaii.uh/ (accept the SSL warning). On the right hand side, click on vSphere Web Client (HTML5) and log in with your Hawaii Domain account.                 &nbsp;            Login with your Hawaii Domain account, which should be in the form of &quot;hawaii//&lt;username&gt;&quot; or &quot;username@hawaii.uh&quot; as in the example below.                    Click on the&nbsp;VM and Templates&nbsp;icon and expand esx_datacenter. Your VMs may be organized in a folder if you own several of them.            &nbsp;            Expand the inventory tree on the left-hand side of the page, and browse through it to find the VM you want and then click to select that VM. You may also search for a virtual machine and select it using the Search field in the upper right corner of the page.    &nbsp;            When a VM is selected, click on the Summary tab, then click on the &quot;Launch Web Console&quot; link. The virtual machine console opens in a new tab of the web browser.

    "question": "Virtual Server: How to install and configure backups (Bacula Enterprise) on a Windows Server",
    "answer": "SUMMARY:The Bacula backup service is the optional daily backup service listed in the ITS VMware Hosted Solutions page. Backups are FILE LEVEL only.If you are a VM customer and have purchased this service, a client will need to be configured on your server to communicate with the backup server. This article describes installing and configuring the Bacula client on a Windows Server VM.PREREQUISITESYou should already have this service purchased through ITS Managed Services. A staff member will provide information to the private network for the backups:Private network IP addressPrivate network gateway addressPrivate network subnet maskAn additional network interface (NIC) for the private network will also be added on the VM and an installation file for the Bacula Enterprise client will be sent to you (via UH Filedrop).PLEASE NOTE: Some virtual servers were not configured to have two networks. If your server has only one network, please follow these instructions.DETAILS:Part I: Configuring the private network and adding static routesPart II: Configuring the backup clientPart I: Configuring the private network and adding static routes    Confirm that you have a secondary network interface added on your VM. This can be viewed in the Network Connections window, or by going to Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Network and Sharing Center &gt; Change adapter settings.                To easily differentiate between the two interfaces, you can rename your primary interface to something like &quot;Public&quot; and &quot;Backup-private&quot; for the secondary interface. The public network interface has the public facing IP configured for the VM.    &nbsp;    Right-click on the secondary (private) interface and go to Properties. Uncheck &quot;Internet Protocal Version 6 (TCP/IPv6)&quot; and select &quot;Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)&quot; and click Properties.            &nbsp;    Select &quot;Use the following IP address&quot; in the window that opens and fill out the network information.        Below is an example of what the configuration will look like. The IP address in the screenshot is just an example; your actual private IP address will be provided by staff.                IP address: provided by ITS staff    Subnet mask: provided by ITS staff    Default gateway: left BLANK        Preferred DNS server: 192.168.10.115    Alternate DNS server: 192.168.10.116        Click OK to confirm the settings and save.    &nbsp;    &nbsp;Next, static routes will need to be configured on the private network interface. Open the Command Prompt and run as an admistrator and enter         netstat -r         to display the routing table (the window will need to be expanded to show the entire output).        Take note of the Interface List in the output as you will need to note down the interface number. In this example, the interface number of the secondard private interface is &quot;16&quot; (outlined in red below). You should also double-check the MAC address to make sure it is correct.                &nbsp;        Run the following commands in the terminal to add the static routes. You will need to know your private gateway IP address as provided by Managed Services staff.        route add 10.0.0.0 mask 255.0.0.0 &lt;gateway IP&gt; -p IF &lt;interface number&gt;    route add 172.16.0.0 mask 255.240.0.0 &lt;gateway IP&gt; -p IF &lt;interface number&gt;    route add 192.168.0.0 mask 255.255.0.0 &lt;gateway IP&gt; -p IF &lt;interface number&gt;                 The screenshot example shows adding the three static routes to the private gateway IP address&nbsp;172.17.36.1 to the secondary network interface, which Windows defined as 16.            Enter netstat -r again in the command prompt to confirm the addition of the static routes.                    To test that the routes are properly configured, run the nslookup command on these two hosts to verify it resolves to those IPs. This ensures that the server is able to see the two Bacula backup servers.        dr-dir12.pvt.hawaii.edu 172.24.100.11    dr-sto12.pvt.hawaii.edu 172.24.100.12        NOTE: On Windows Server 2016, the nslookup command may not properly resolve the Bacula hosts unless you specify the private DNS server, i.e.        nslookup dr-dir12.pvt.hawaii.edu 192.168.10.115            Update the Windows Firewall to allow incoming traffic on ports 9102 and 9103 from dr-dir12.pvt.hawaii.edu (172.24.100.11) and dr-sto12.pvt.hawaii.edu (172.24.100.12).                    Reference on configuring Windows Firewall: https://www.rootusers.com/configure-windows-firewall-advanced-security/                &nbsp;                Single-Network ServersYour  virtual server may not have been configured with two networks. If you  have a single public network assigned on your server, you do not need to  setup static routing.Please be sure to change the DNS addresses on the public network interface to the following:192.168.10.115192.168.10.116Then, run nslookup dr-dir12.pvt.hawaii.edu 192.168.10.115 to verify that the Bacula server host can be resolved. After that, you may follow the instructions to install the Bacula client.&nbsp;Part II: Configuring the backup client    &nbsp;Install the Bacula Enterprise 8.6.16 client (bacula-enterprise-win64-8.6.16.exe) by right-clicking the file and selecting &ldquo;Run as Administrator&rdquo;.        Click Next at the below dialog box.            If you agree to the license agreement, click I Agree at the below dialog box.            Choose Automatic at the below dialog box and then click Next.            When the dialog box below appears, select the items below and uncheck the others.        Client    Plugins    - Place a checkmark next to &ldquo;alldrives Plugin&rdquo;    - Place a checkmark next to &ldquo;winbmr Plugin&rdquo;    - Uncheck &ldquo;Old (deprecated) Exchange Plugin&rdquo;        Enter the following value into the DIR Name field.        DIR Name:&nbsp; bacula-dir        Leave the &ldquo;Save Client template in&rdquo; checkbox UNCHECKED.            Click Finish at the below dialog box.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s probably a good idea to read the Readme file.        &nbsp;    &nbsp;Open Notepad as an Administrator (right-click it and go to &quot;Run as Administrator). Open C://Programs Files//Bacula//bacula-fd.conf.         In the below section, remove the &ldquo;-fd&rdquo; from the shortname of the  host (for example, hostname-fd to hostname).&nbsp; Also, change Maximum Concurrent Jobs to  20.    FileDaemon {&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # this is me    &nbsp;&nbsp; Name = hostname    &nbsp;&nbsp; FDport = 9102&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # where we listen for the director    &nbsp;&nbsp; WorkingDirectory = &quot;C:////Program Files////Bacula////working&quot;    &nbsp;&nbsp; Pid Directory = &quot;C:////Program Files////Bacula////working&quot;    &nbsp;&nbsp; Plugin Directory = &quot;C:////Program Files////Bacula////plugins&quot;    &nbsp;&nbsp; Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 20    }        DELETE the below section:    #     # Restricted Director, used by tray-monitor to get the     #&nbsp;&nbsp; status of the file daemon     #     Director {     &nbsp; Name = hostname-mon     &nbsp; Password =&quot;some-password&quot;     &nbsp; Monitor = yes      }        In the &quot;some-password&quot; field, copy this password and save it in a separate text file. You will need to file drop this to us so that it can be configured on our end.    #     # List Directors who are permitted to contact this File daemon    #    Director {    &nbsp;&nbsp; Name = bacula-dir    &nbsp;&nbsp; Password = &quot;some-password&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # Director must know this password    }    &nbsp;    Save your changes to the bacula-fd.conf file and close it. You may want to re-open it again just to ensure changed have been saved.     Go to Administrative Tools &gt; Services and restart the Bacula File Backup Service. Search for Bacula File Backup Service right click, and select Restart.                 The process should start with no errors. If you get an error or if the process hangs, review the previous steps to ensure Bacula was installed and configured correctly.    &nbsp;    The Bacula installation and setup process is now complete. Email itscs@hawaii.edu to let us know that the client has been configured. A staff member will respond and ask you to send the password (via UH Filedrop) that you saved earlier so we can start the backups.    &nbsp;&nbsp;RELATED ARTICLES:Data Center ServicesVirtual Hosting: How to Submit a Restore RequestVirtual Server: File Level Backup PolicyVirtual Server: How to install and configure backups (Bacula) on a Red Hat Linux Server"

    "answer": "The following information is provided to help virtual server customers of Information Technology Services (ITS) Managed Services understand the nature  of the backup procedures if they choose the ITS offered backup service.Virtual servers are required to have backups.See more information at&nbsp;Data Center Services for pricing information.To use a non-ITS backup solution, please see: Virtual Server: ITS Customer Backup Policy (non-ITS Backup Solution)Important information to consider:    Bacula takes file-level backups, and cannot perform system restores.&nbsp;&nbsp;            Should a catastrophe occur, essential data that was backed up would be recoverable, but the operating system, settings, and any applications would need to be reinstalled and configured.        &nbsp;            Windows files that are open while a backup is being made will be backed up by Volume Snapshot Servers (VSS). VSS allows for files to be backed up when in use.    &nbsp;    Linux does not have VSS, so files should be closed prior to the backup window to ensure they are backed up.    &nbsp;    Bacula will not backup databases live.&nbsp; If you are running a database server, you will either need to stop or pause your database services during the backup window, or export your database and store the copy in a location that's being backed up.    &nbsp;    Please refer to the&nbsp;Virtual Hosting SLA&nbsp;on retention period for your backup. Backups that are beyond this retention period are automatically expired.

    "question": "Virtual Server: How to Install and Configure Backups (Bacula) on a RHEL Server",
    "answer": "SUMMARYThe Bacula Enterprise Edition (BEE) backup service is the optional daily backup service listed in the&nbsp;ITS VMware Hosted Solutions&nbsp;page. Backups are file level only.If you are a virtual server customer and have purchased the daily backup service, a BEE client  will need to be configured on your server to communicate with the backup  server. This article describes installing and configuring the BEE client on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) virtual server.PREREQUISITES    You should already have the daily backup service purchased through ITS Managed Services. If you have not already done so, please contact ITS Managed Services at itscs@hawaii.edu to do so.    &nbsp;    You should already have a private network connection on your virtual server. For more information, please see Virtual Server: How to Connect Your ITS-Hosted RHEL 7 Virtual Server to an ITS Private Network.PROCEDUREDo the following to install a BEE client on your RHEL virtual server:    Contact ITS Managed Services at itscs@hawaii.edu asking that the latest version of the BEE client .rpm packages be file dropped to you (via the UH Filedrop service). Once you have these files, upload them to your virtual server's /root directory.    Log into your virtual server and switch user to the root user.    &nbsp;    Install the BEE client software:#&nbsp;cd /root#&nbsp;yum install -y ./bacula-enterprise-*.rpmNOTE: You may need to install the bacula-enterprise-lib-*.rpm file first before installing the bacula-enterprise-client-*.rpm file.    Modify the /opt/bacula/etc/bacula-fd.conf file (installed when you install the BEE client) as outlined in the following example. In this example, &quot;bac10&quot; is used as the hostname, but for your server, it should be the short hostname of your virtual server.(a)&nbsp;Change this:Director {&nbsp; Name = bac10-dir&nbsp; Password = &quot;&lt; random_password_1 &gt;&quot;}To this (change the Name and use the randomly generated password, or create your own):Director {&nbsp; Name = bacula-dir&nbsp; Password = &quot;&lt;random-password&gt;&quot;}&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Change this:Director {&nbsp; Name = bac10-mon&nbsp; Password = &quot;a long random password&quot;&nbsp; Monitor = yes}&nbsp;To this (comment out all lines by prefixing them with a &quot;#&quot;):#Director {#&nbsp;&nbsp;Name =&nbsp;bacula-dir-mon#&nbsp;&nbsp;Password = &quot;a long random password&quot;#&nbsp;&nbsp;Monitor = yes#}&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;Change this:FileDaemon { &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;# this is me&nbsp; Name = bac10-fd&nbsp; FDport = 9102 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;# where we listen for the director&nbsp; WorkingDirectory = /opt/bacula/working&nbsp; Pid Directory = /opt/bacula/working&nbsp; Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 20&nbsp; Plugin Directory = /opt/bacula/plugins}&nbsp;To this (remove &quot;-fd&quot; from shortname of the host. &nbsp;Change Maximum Concurrent Jobs to 20):FileDaemon { &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;# this is me&nbsp; Name =&nbsp;bac10&nbsp; FDport = 9102 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;# where we listen for the director&nbsp; WorkingDirectory = /opt/bacula/working&nbsp; Pid Directory = /opt/bacula/working&nbsp; Maximum Concurrent Jobs =&nbsp;20&nbsp; Plugin Directory = /opt/bacula/plugins}&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;Change this:Messages {&nbsp; Name = Standard&nbsp; director = bac10-dir = all, !skipped, !restored, !saved}To this (change director name):Messages {&nbsp; Name = Standard&nbsp; director =&nbsp;bacula-dir&nbsp;= all, !skipped, !restored, !saved}    Enable automatic start of the BEE client upon server boot:    RHEL 7 and 8: # systemctl enable&nbsp;bacula-fd    Restart bacula-fd service:    RHEL 7 and 8: # systemctl&nbsp;start bacula-fd    Run the following command to allow port 9102 incoming for the backup traffic:        firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=9102/tcp &amp;&amp; firewall-cmd --reload.    &nbsp;    (Optional) If TCP Wrappers is configured in the OS, add a rule to allow incoming connections from the Bacula Director Server dr-dir12.pvt.hawaii.edu. E.g., modify the&nbsp;/etc/hosts.allow file to add the line &quot;ALL: 172.24.100.11 dr-dir12.pvt.hawaii.edu&quot;).    (Optional) Delete the bacula-enterprise-* .rpm files from /root.    &nbsp;    Notify IT TI-Applications&nbsp;that you have completed installing the BEE client on your virtual server. Please let us know the name of your virtual server, which directories you want backed up, and an estimate of you much storage space you expect the backup to require.&nbsp;Do not include the Bacula password in this email. If it is emailed in clear text, you will be required to change the password. A staff member from Contract Services will respond to you and ask you to send the password you made note of in step 4b above via the&nbsp;UH Filedrop&nbsp;service.RELATED ARTICLES    Data Center Services    Virtual Hosting: How to Submit a Restore Request    Virtual Server: File Level Backup Policy    Virtual Server: How to install and configure backups (Bacula) on a Windows Server                              Virtual Server: How to Connect Your ITS-Hosted RHEL 6 Virtual Server to an ITS Private Network    Virtual Server: How to Connect Your ITS-Hosted RHEL 7 Virtual Server to an ITS Private Network&nbsp;"

    "question": "Virtual Server: How to Connect Your ITS-Hosted RHEL 7 Virtual Server to an ITS Private Network",
    "answer": "OVERVIEWSometimes in order to access certain services offered by UH Information Technology Services (ITS) from your ITS-hosted virtual server, you will need to have access to an ITS private network. The instructions in this article give you instructions on how to make sure your virtual server is connected to an ITS private network.&nbsp;These instructions only apply to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 virtual servers created by ITS Managed Services for your use, and only to RHEL systems that have the Network Manager service removed or turned off (e.g., &ldquo;systemctl networkmanager stop&rdquo; and &ldquo;systemctl networkmanager disable&rdquo;; also see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7-Beta/html/Networking_Guide/sec-NetworkManager_and_the_Network_Scripts.html).&nbsp;These instructions are for RHEL 7 environments where the network configuration files are manually maintained, which is the standard configuration for RHEL 6 virtual servers created by ITS Managed Services. You can still use Network Manager if you like, but ITS does not provide instructions for adding a private network connection when Network Manager is enabled so you will have to determine the appropriate procedure yourself.&nbsp;PROCEDURE&nbsp;NOTE: All the commands given in the steps below are assumed to be issued as either user root or via &quot;sudo&quot;.    Enter the command:ifconfig&nbsp;to see all installed and connected NICs on your virtual server, and make note of the interface/NIC names of the NICs that are installed (e.g., &ldquo;eno16780032&rdquo;, &ldquo;ens224&rdquo; ,etc.). You may want to send the output of the &ldquo;ifconfig&rdquo; command to a text file for later reference&mdash;e.g., &ldquo;ifconfig &gt; ifconfig_results_2017-07-06.txt&rdquo;.For example:#&nbsp;ifconfigeno16780032: flags=4163&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt;&nbsp; mtu 1500&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; inet 166.122.3.161&nbsp; netmask 255.255.255.0&nbsp; broadcast 166.122.3.255&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; inet6 fe80::250:56ff:feb0:2ddd&nbsp; prefixlen 64&nbsp; scopeid 0x20&lt;link&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ether 00:50:56:b0:2d:dd&nbsp; txqueuelen 1000&nbsp; (Ethernet)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RX packets 1185&nbsp; bytes 102807 (100.3 KiB)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RX errors 0&nbsp; dropped 0&nbsp; overruns 0&nbsp; frame 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TX packets 198&nbsp; bytes 23317 (22.7 KiB)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TX errors 0&nbsp; dropped 0 overruns 0&nbsp; carrier 0&nbsp; collisions 0ens224: flags=4163&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt;&nbsp; mtu 1500&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; inet 172.17.36.14&nbsp; netmask 255.255.255.0&nbsp; broadcast 172.17.36.255&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; inet6 fe80::250:56ff:feb0:5673&nbsp; prefixlen 64&nbsp; scopeid 0x20&lt;link&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ether 00:50:56:b0:56:73&nbsp; txqueuelen 1000&nbsp; (Ethernet)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RX packets 689&nbsp; bytes 146959 (143.5 KiB)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RX errors 0&nbsp; dropped 0&nbsp; overruns 0&nbsp; frame 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TX packets 688&nbsp; bytes 89245 (87.1 KiB)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TX errors 0&nbsp; dropped 0 overruns 0&nbsp; carrier 0&nbsp; collisions 0lo: flags=73&lt;UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING&gt;&nbsp; mtu 65536&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; inet 127.0.0.1&nbsp; netmask 255.0.0.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; inet6 ::1&nbsp; prefixlen 128&nbsp; scopeid 0x10&lt;host&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; loop&nbsp; txqueuelen 1&nbsp; (Local Loopback)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RX packets 0&nbsp; bytes 0 (0.0 B)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RX errors 0&nbsp; dropped 0&nbsp; overruns 0&nbsp; frame 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TX packets 0&nbsp; bytes 0 (0.0 B)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TX errors 0&nbsp; dropped 0 overruns 0&nbsp; carrier 0&nbsp; collisions 0&nbsp;    In the output of the &quot;ifconfig&quot; command, look at the &ldquo;inet&rdquo; setting for each NIC (if there is one) and see if any have a value&nbsp;other than&nbsp;128.171.*.* (e.g., 128.171.38.164) or 166.122.3.* (e.g., 166.122.3.3) or 127.0.0.1 (the standard internal loopback interface). Any value other than those subnets indicate the NIC does have a private network IP associated with it. If no &quot;inet addr&quot; setting is listed for a NIC, it means that the NIC is connected but has not been configured with an IPv4 IP address yet, and ITS CS will need to verify if the NIC is connected to a private network or not (step 4 below).    &nbsp;    If a NIC on your virtual server does have a private network IP associated with it, please skip to step 17 below (verify DNS resolves .pvt and .mgt). Otherwise, continue with the next step below.    Contact ITS Managed Services (itscs@hawaii.edu) and ask that your virtual server be assigned to and connected to an ITS private network. As part of your request, please provide the following info:* The reason you want to add an ITS private network connection to your virtual server* Your virtual server&rsquo;s fully qualified domain name (FQDN) (e.g., leeddash.its.hawaii.edu)* Your virtual server&rsquo;s public network IP address (128.171.x.x or 166.122.3.x)&nbsp;    ITS Managed Services will verify that your virtual server does not have a connection to an ITS private network, and if so they will assign your virtual server an IP within an ITS private network, attach a new NIC on your virtual server that connects to that network, and provide you with the private network IP, gateway, and subnet mask information.    &nbsp;    Once you have the private network IP, gateway, and subnet mask information from ITS CS, do an &ldquo;ifconfig&rdquo; command and make note of the newly added NIC&rsquo;s name (e.g., &ldquo;ens224&rdquo;), as well as the NIC name of the existing primary NIC for the public network (e.g., &ldquo;eno16780032&rdquo;).    &nbsp;    Back up the existing&nbsp;/etc/sysconfig/network&nbsp;file (e.g., &ldquo;cp /etc/sysconfig/network /etc/sysconfig/network.2017-07-06&rdquo;) and then edit the&nbsp;/etc/sysconfig/network&nbsp;file and ensure it contains only the following lines (substitute the bracketed items with appropriate values):&nbsp;NETWORKING=yesHOSTNAME=&lt;Host-FQDN&gt;GATEWAY=&lt;Gateway-IP-For-Primary-NIC-Public-Network&gt;GATEWAYDEV=&lt;Primary-NIC-Name&gt;&nbsp;For example:&nbsp;NETWORKING=yesHOSTNAME=cstemplate06.its.hawaii.eduGATEWAY=166.122.3.1GATEWAYDEV=eno16780032&nbsp;    Create a&nbsp;/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-&lt;NIC-name&gt;&nbsp;file (where&nbsp;&lt;NIC-name&gt;&nbsp;is the name of the new NIC as determined in step 6; e.g.,&nbsp;/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ens224). You can do so with &ldquo;vi&rdquo; or &quot;nano&quot; any basic text editor of your choice (or perhaps just copying the primary non-private NIC&rsquo;s config file and just editing it&mdash;e.g., &ldquo;cp /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eno16780032 /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ens224&rdquo;).    &nbsp;    Edit the new&nbsp;ifcfg-&lt;NIC-name&gt;&nbsp;file created in the previous step so that it contains the following minimal entries:&nbsp;DEVICE=&ldquo;&lt;NIC-name&gt;&rdquo;BOOTPROTO=staticONBOOT=yesUSERCTL=noIPADDR=&lt;Assigned-Private-Network-IP&gt;NETMASK=&lt;Assigned-Private-Network-Subnet-Mask&gt;PEERDNS=no&nbsp;For example:&nbsp;DEVICE=&quot;ens224&quot;BOOTPROTO=staticONBOOT=yesUSERCTL=noIPADDR=172.17.36.14NETMASK=255.255.255.0PEERDNS=no&nbsp;&nbsp;    Create and edit a new&nbsp;/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-&lt;NIC-name&gt;&nbsp;file (where&nbsp;&lt;NIC-name&gt;&nbsp;is the name of the new NIC; e.g.,&nbsp;/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-ens224) that contains the following lines:&nbsp;192.168.0.0/16 via&nbsp;&lt;Assigned-Private-Network-Gateway-IP&gt;&nbsp;dev&nbsp;&lt;NIC-name&gt;172.16.0.0/12 via&nbsp;&lt;Assigned-Private-Network-Gateway-IP&gt;&nbsp;dev&nbsp;&lt;NIC-name&gt;10.0.0.0/8 via&nbsp;&lt;Assigned-Private-Network-Gateway-IP&gt;&nbsp;dev&nbsp;&lt;NIC-name&gt;&nbsp;For example:&nbsp;192.168.0.0/16 via 172.17.65.1 dev eth1172.16.0.0/12 via 172.17.65.1 dev eth110.0.0.0/8 via 172.17.65.1 dev eth1&nbsp;    Schedule a reboot the virtual server to incorporate all the changes you&rsquo;ve made so far (just restarting the network service doesn't seem to be enough). E.g., when ready, as user root, enter the following command to reboot:reboot&nbsp;    Log back into the server and switch user to the &quot;root&quot; user (if you cannot access the server after rebooting, you may need to log in via the virtual console to troubleshoot if you have access [see Virtual Server: How to Access Your Virtual Server via VMware Console Access] or contact ITS CS at itscs@hawaii.edu to help you); one there, print out the current network routing table using the command:&nbsp;ip route show&nbsp;    Examine the results of the &ldquo;ip route show&rdquo; command and ensure that among the entries shown are ones similar to those given in step 10 above and also a &ldquo;default&rdquo; entry that specifies the primary (public) NIC&rsquo;s gateway and NIC name.

As long as your mobile device has mobile network or wi-fi service, authentication requests can be pushed to your device via the Duo Mobile app.  You can download the Duo Mobile app to an iOS or Android device that meets the minimum requirements.                        iOS            Please see&nbsp;https://guide.duo.com/iphone&nbsp;for the supported version of iOS                            Android            Please see&nbsp;https://guide.duo.com/android&nbsp;for the supported version of Android            Once you have downloaded the Duo Mobile app and registered your mobile device, authentication requests will be &quot;pushed&quot; to your device through the Duo Mobile app.  You would then open the Duo Mobile app and tap on &quot;Approve&quot; or &quot;Deny&quot; to approve or deny the authentication request.Duo Passcode via the Duo Mobile AppThe Duo Mobile app can be used to generate a passcode that can be used to login. Passcodes can be generated without requiring internet access, and can be used even if your mobile device is in airplane mode or otherwise not connected to a WiFi or mobile network with internet access. This is a great option to use when traveling or when in areas where access to the internet might not be guaranteed.Phone CallYou can opt to authenticate via a phone call to a landline or mobile phone.  When it's time to authenticate, you will receive a call on your registered phone number.  You would then push &quot;1&quot; on your phone's keypad to authenticate, or push &quot;9&quot; to deny the authentication request.Regarding phone numbers beginning with &quot;+86&quot;ITS has been informed by Duo that due to recent telephony restrictions by the Chinese government, Duo is no longer able to authenticate by phone calls to users with +86 numbers.  If you have a +86 phone number registered in Duo, you will see the following notice:&nbsp;Other methods, such as Duo Push, SMS passcodes, or hard tokens will still work.  For more information, please refer to the following Duo knowledgebase article:https://help.duo.com/s/article/5001SMS PasscodesIf you do not have a smartphone, but you have a mobile phone with SMS/text messaging capabilities, you can use SMS passcodes to authenticate. When requested, a set of 10 passcodes will be sent to you as a text (SMS) message to your phone.  Each time you authenticate, you would use the next passcode in the sequence. After you've used all 10 passcodes, you can request a new set of 10 passcodes. You can also request a new set of 10 passcodes at any time. After you've requested a set of 10 passcodes, you can continue to use all of the passcodes in succession to authenticate even if your mobile device is no longer connected to mobile network.Yubikey Hard TokenA hard token (sometimes called an authentication or security token) is a hardware security device that is used to authorize a user.  UH provides Yubikey hard tokens for purchase.  The UH hard token is a usb device and must be inserted into your usb port to be used.  You would then touch the hard token anytime you wanted to authenticate.  If you do not have an available usb port, you cannot authenticate with the UH hard token. Hard tokens are not recommended and should be purchased only if you cannot use any of the other above means for authenticating.For information on purchasing a UH hard token, please visit https://www.hawaii.edu/sitelic/tokens/Step 2: Decide which two devices you want to useITS strongly recommends that you setup at least two devices for MFA.  This is so that if one of your devices becomes unavailable (e.g smartphone forgotten or lost), you can still authenticate.  Some samples of multiple devices could be:    Smartphone and office landline    Smartphone, office landline, and home landlineOnce you have decided which two (or more) devices you will use for MFA, proceed to the next step (Step 3) of setting up your first device.  If you have already setup one device, you may proceed to step 4 to add more devices.Step 3: Setup your first device/tUH Login Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - Getting started with your first device/t    Setting up a Smartphone    Setting up a Landline    Setting up a non-Smartphone Cellular Phone    Setting up a TabletFor more information about UH Login and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), go to www.hawaii.edu/its/uhlogin.Before going through this article, please review UH Login Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - Which authentication method should I use? to determine which authentication method suits your situation best.

    "question": "Spirion Actions: Shred, Redact, Encrypt, and Quarantine",
    "answer": "After scanning a device and Spirion finds potential matches for sensitive or private data, you are given the ability to perform four actions: Shred, Redact, Encrypt, and Quarantine. Below is an explanation of what each action does.ShredChoosing Shred will delete the entire file found to have sensitive data using the U.S. Department of Defense deletion standard, known as DOD 5220.22-M. Shredded files CANNOT be recovered.Shred works on all file types.RedactChoosing Redact will attempt to replace the highlighted data from the Preview Pane with a string of x characters. This will keep all other data in the file intact.Redact has been tested to work on .txt, .docx, .pptx, .xlsx, and .csv files.EncryptChoosing Encrypt will attempt to encrypt the file using its associated application first. For example, if the file is a PDF, Spirion will attempt to encrypt the file using the PDF standard. The entire file will be encrypted, leaving the data unreadable until decrypted. If successful, your Spirion Profile password is required to unlock and view the file. The file will remain encrypted after each viewing.If that fails, Spirion will store the selected file in a &quot;Spirion Vault File&quot;, which requires the user's profile password to decrypt. The Entire file will be encrypted, leaving the data unreadable until decrypted. Performing an decryption does so permanently, not temporarily. You will need to encrypt the file again manually after each decryption.Encrypt works on all file types.QuarantineChoosing Quarantine will move the file to a &quot;quarantined location&quot; and shred it from its original location. You will be asked to select the quarantine location in a pop-up menu.Note: This will NOT shred, redact, or encrypt the data in any way. This just moves the data to another location. The sensitive data will still be accessible in the file.Quarantine works on all file types."

    "question": "Virtual Server: How to Configure Static Routes on a Windows Server",
    "answer": "SUMMARY:There may be a circumstance that requires you to have multiple network adapters on your Virtual Machine (VM). Multiple adapters may be required for accessing resources on a private network, or for backing up your server with Bacula Enterprise. For the full instructions on installing and configuring Bacula Enterprise, see the instructions here.Static routes are required when multiple network adapters are configured, so that only one network gateway is allowed at a time.This article assumes you will be configuring a private network adapter on the ITS private network on a Windows Server. The steps may differ if you're configuring static routes for a non-ITS private network.PREREQUISITESYou will need (provided by ITS Managed Services):Private IP addressPrivate gateway IP addressPrivate subnet maskAn additional network interface (NIC) for the private network will also  be added on the VM by Managed Services (MS) staff. You will need to manually input the IP addresses in the network configuration. Follow the screenshot in the example below. Make sure to leave the &quot;Default gateway&quot; BLANK. Use these DNS servers for the ITS private network:192.168.10.115192.168.10.116NOTE: For non-ITS networks, the DNS servers will be different.    Static routes will need to be configured on the private  network interface. Open the Command Prompt and run as an admistrator and  enter         netstat -r         to display the routing table (the window will need to be expanded to show the entire output).        Take note of the Interface List in the output as  you will need to note down the interface number. In this example, the  interface number of the secondary private interface is &quot;16&quot; (outlined in  red below). You should also double-check the MAC address to make sure  it is correct.                &nbsp;        Run the following commands in the terminal to add the static routes. You will need to know your private gateway IP address as provided by MS staff.        route add 10.0.0.0 mask 255.0.0.0 &lt;gateway IP&gt; -p IF &lt;interface number&gt;    route add 172.16.0.0 mask 255.240.0.0 &lt;gateway IP&gt; -p IF &lt;interface number&gt;    route add 192.168.0.0 mask 255.255.0.0 &lt;gateway IP&gt; -p IF &lt;interface number&gt;                 The screenshot example shows adding the three static routes to the private gateway IP address&nbsp;172.17.36.1 to the secondary network interface, which Windows defined as 16.            Enter netstat -r again in the command prompt to confirm the addition of the static routes.                    To test that the routes are properly configured, enter         nslookup dr-dir12.pvt.hawaii.edu        to see if the DNS servers will resolve the offsite backup server. If it resolves, the output below will be displayed.             &nbsp;    &nbsp;"

The third argument to define() may no longer be true.    The ability to specify an autoloader using an __autoload() function has been removed. spl_autoload_register() should be used instead.    create_function() has been removed. Anonymous functions may be used instead.    each() has been removed. foreach or ArrayIterator should be used instead.    The ability to unbind this from closures that were created from a method, using Closure::fromCallable() or ReflectionMethod::getClosure(), has been removed.    The ability to unbind this from proper closures that contain uses of this has also been removed.    The ability to use array_key_exists() with objects has been removed. isset() or property_exists() may be used instead.    The @ operator will no longer silence fatal errors (E_ERROR, E_CORE_ERROR, E_COMPILE_ERROR, E_USER_ERROR, E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR, E_PARSE).    #[ is no longer interpreted as the start of a comment, as this syntax is now used for attributes.    Support for deprecated curly braces for offset access has been removed.    EXIF: read_exif_data() has been removed; exif_read_data() should be used instead.    GD: The deprecated function image2wbmp() has been removed.    GD: The deprecated functions png2wbmp() and jpeg2wbmp() have been removed.    GMP: gmp_random() has been removed. One of gmp_random_range() or gmp_random_bits() should be used instead.    IMAP: The imap_header() function which is an alias of imap_headerinfo() has been removed.    LDAP: The deprecated functions ldap_sort(), ldap_control_paged_result() and ldap_control_paged_result_response() have been removed.    MBString:&nbsp;&nbsp;The ISO_8859-* character encoding aliases have been replaced by ISO8859-* aliases for better interoperability with the iconv extension. The mbregex ISO 8859 aliases with underscores (ISO_8859_* and ISO8859_*) have also been removed.    OCI8:&nbsp; oci_internal_debug() and its alias ociinternaldebug() have been removed.    SPL:&nbsp; SplFileObject::fgetss() has been removed.    SPL:&nbsp;&nbsp;SplFixedArray is now an IteratorAggregate and not an Iterator. SplFixedArray::rewind(), SplFixedArray::current(), SplFixedArray::key(), SplFixedArray::next(), and SplFixedArray::valid() have been removed. In their place, SplFixedArray::getIterator() has been added. Any code which uses explicit iteration over SplFixedArray must now obtain an Iterator through SplFixedArray::getIterator(). This means that SplFixedArray is now safe to use in nested loops.    assert() will no longer evaluate string arguments, instead they will be treated like any other argument. assert($a == $b) should be used instead of assert('$a == $b'). The assert.quiet_eval ini directive and the ASSERT_QUIET_EVAL constant have also been removed, as they would no longer have any effect.    The string.strip_tags filter has been removed.    The following functions have been removed:            hebrevc()        convert_cyr_string()        money_format()        ezmlm_hash()        restore_include_path()        get_magic_quotes_gpc()        get_magic_quotes_runtime()        fgetss()&nbsp;            FILTER_SANITIZE_MAGIC_QUOTES has been removed.    gzgetss() has been removed.For detailed information about the php upgrade, please check out this PHP migration guide, with particular focus on 'Backward Incompatible Changes' and 'Removed Extensions' :    PHP 7.4 &gt; PHP 8.0Other notesIf you are experiencing errors with your site, please email us at web-support-l@lists.hawaii.edu with the date and time of your error and a copy of the error messages you may have received.&nbsp;If you any comments, concerns, or questions, please email us at web-support-l@lists.hawaii.edu"

    "answer": "Note: This deferral feature is no longer available starting with Windows 10 version 2004.This deferral process is available only on PCs running business and education editions, such as Windows 10 Pro, Windows 10 Enterprise, and Windows 10 Education. Windows 10 Home does not offer any deferral options.To defer Windows upgrades, Go to Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update, then click Advanced options.    Option 1 allows you to choose a servicing channel. The default setting is Semi-Annual Channel (Targeted)which means the update is ready for most people. &nbsp;You can change this setting to Semi-Annual Channel which defers feature updates until Microsoft declares them &quot;ready for widespread use in organizations.&quot;    Option 2 allows you to specify additional time after the official release to the channel you selected. You can delay the upgrade by up to an additional 365 days from its initial release date.    Option 3 works independently of the feature update settings and allows you to defer the monthly cumulative security updates and any additional out-of-band updates by up to 30 days.&nbsp;"

On the date ITS is notified of the event, the account will remain open for 180 days, after which the account is deleted.Employee/AffiliateIn the unfortunate event that an employee or UH affiliated person should pass away, the following procedure will be used by ITS:        Dean/Director notifies ITS of the event and ITS will change the account&rsquo;s password. The following information is required so that ITS can create an auto-reply message and to ensure that no new email is accepted            Name of the deceased        Responsible party in the unit to whom external correspondents can be referred, typically the manager, department chair, dean, director, etc. For this individual, we require their name, title, and email address.            Dean/Director notifies ITS of the email agent who will be responsible for reviewing the email of the deceased to ensure that no official business is outstanding. The email agent would be the person entrusted to go through the desk of the deceased to separate personal items from UH business materials.        ITS will set the account to auto-reply to incoming messages. The standard message (subject to change by Dean/Director) is:    This is an automated message.

These are either replied to or forwarded as appropriate based on context. Upon completion of the review and handling, the email agent can either delete all messages or ask ITS to do so.    On the date ITS is notified of the event, the account will remain open for 180 days, after which the account is deleted.Account TerminationUniversity unit authorities (e.g. Vice Presidents, Chancellors, Vice Chancellors, Deans, Directors, Department Head, Administrative Officers, etc.) can request a UH Account termination for a faculty, staff, or affiliate under their purview by making a formal request on departmental letterhead. The signature of the University unit authority (or their designee) is required. When the termination is requested, it is possible that the individual using the UH Account has established additional affiliations with UH, such as becoming a student or becoming a faculty or staff with another UH unit. ITS will research all termination requests in order to ascertain if there are additional affiliations by the individual. If there are no other affiliations, the UH Email Account will be flagged for termination. By default, the UH Account will remain open for 180 days. If access to the UH Account must be immediately cut-off, the letter must explicitly request this.Requests should be sent via&nbsp;File Drop&nbsp;to the ITS Help Desk at help@hawaii.edu/tUH Account Privacy Policy/tUnder normal circumstances, email is considered private and is not subject to audit or review except as stated in UH Executive Policy E2.210: &ldquo;Use and Management of Information Technology Resources&rdquo;.

This includes the continued availability of all data stored in Google@UH services, such as email messages and folders in Google@UH Gmail, data in Google@UH Drive, and sites in Google@UH Sites. POP and IMAP access to Google@UH Gmail will also continue.    STAR -- The University STAR academic advising service allows most alumni to create information transcripts.

These are either replied to or forwarded as appropriate based on context. Upon completion of the review and handling, the email agent can either delete all messages or ask ITS to do so.    On the date ITS is notified of the event, the account will remain open for 180 days, after which the account is deleted.Account TerminationUniversity unit authorities (e.g. Vice Presidents, Chancellors, Vice Chancellors, Deans, Directors, Department Head, Administrative Officers, etc.) can request a UH Account termination for a faculty, staff, or affiliate under their purview by making a formal request on departmental letterhead. The signature of the University unit authority (or their designee) is required. When the termination is requested, it is possible that the individual using the UH Account has established additional affiliations with UH, such as becoming a student or becoming a faculty or staff with another UH unit. ITS will research all termination requests in order to ascertain if there are additional affiliations by the individual. If there are no other affiliations, the UH Email Account will be flagged for termination. By default, the UH Account will remain open for 180 days. If access to the UH Account must be immediately cut-off, the letter must explicitly request this.Requests should be sent via&nbsp;File Drop&nbsp;to the ITS Help Desk at help@hawaii.edu"

    "question": "Enabling Screen Lock on macOS",
    "answer": "Enabling the Lock Screen    Open your System Preferences. This can be found either in your dock or by clicking on the apple logo in the top-left corner of the screen and selecting &quot;System Preferences&quot; in the drop-down menu.               Select Security and Privacy. This will be in the top row of icons.               This window gives you access to setting lock screen delay, changing or setting new passwords, disk encryption, firewall, and app permissions. For this article, we will focus on the lock screen delay setting, which is located in the &quot;General&quot; tab.    Set a password if you have not already and click on the first checkbox to require a password. Click on the &quot;Immediately&quot; option in the drop-down menu. This will cause your laptop to immediately initiate the lock screen whenever the screen turns off or the screensaver turns on.               Please consider using a strong, complex password for your lock screen, as it is your only defense against attackers who have physical access to your Mac. Unlike mobile devices, there is no limit to how many chances an attacker has to crack your password, which makes it easier for brute force attacks utilizing wordlists and rainbow tables (password databases) to quickly guess your password.    If you need guidance for setting a strong password, please refer to this article on Password Guidelines.Locking MethodsThere are a few different ways of locking your screen: Keychain Access, keyboard shortcuts, and Hot Corners. One is not necessarily better than the other; whichever one you feel most comfortable with doing is the best choice.        Keychain Access        The Keychain Access method uses a built-in utility to add a button to the top-right portion of the menu bar. This method does not require you to memorize anything and gives graphical feedback, unlike the other two methods, making this one the easiest to remember.                       Navigate to the Utilities Folder in Applications and double click on Keychain Access.  This can be found by opening Finder, clicking on Applications on the left-hand menu and scrolling down to the folder.                            Once in Keychain Access, open the Preferences.  This can be found in the top bar by clicking on &quot;Keychain Access&quot;.                           Check the &quot;Show keychain status in menu bar&quot; box. After doing so, you can close Keychain Access. This will make the lock icon appear in the menu bar.                           To lock you screen, click on the lock button, and select &quot;Lock Screen&quot;. Now your laptop will require a password when it is next woken up.                                       Keyboard Shortcut                This method is the easiest to implement of the three due to not requiring you to access any settings, but it does require you to memorize a few keystrokes. There are two different keystrokes for different Macs. Once these keys are pressed, your screen will instantly turn black and initiate the lock screen.                    Control + Shift + Eject are the keys to press for Macs with the eject button in the upper right corner of the keyboard.            Control + Shift + Power are the keys to press for Macs without the eject button.                Note that both methods will work with Macs that have the eject button, so memorize whichever one is easiest for you. On newer MacBooks, the power button is located where the eject key is on older models.                Hot Corners                Hot Corners is a feature that allows for different functions to execute when you drag your cursor to a corner of the screen. You can use this to set a corner to initiate either the screensaver or to turn the display off. All four corners can be customized to do different things, so when setting this up, remember which corner you put the lock screen on.                    Open Mission Control. This can be found in System Preferences in the first row of icons.                                       Click on Hot Corners. This button is located on the lower left corner of the Mission Control window. A drop-down menu should appear at the top of the Mission Control window.                                       Choose a corner to &quot;Put Display to Sleep&quot;. Alternatively, you can choose to start the screensaver instead, which will also initiate the lock screen underneath it."

    "question": "Digitally Signing PDFs using Acrobat DC",
    "answer": "Electronic or digital signing must adhere to University policies, including EP 2.218.Using a Digital ID to sign a PDFWhat is a Digital ID?A digital ID is like an electronic driver&rsquo;s license or passport that proves your identity. A digital ID usually contains your name and email address, the name of the organization that issued it, a serial number, and an expiration date. Digital IDs are used for certificate security and digital signatures.Digital IDs contain two keys: the public key locks, or encrypts data; the private key unlocks, or decrypts that data. When you sign PDFs, you use the private key to apply your digital signature. The public key is in a certificate that you distribute to others. For example, you can send the certificate to those who want to validate your signature or identity. Store your digital ID in a safe place, because it contains your private key that others can use to decrypt your information.To sign a document with a certificate-based signature, you must obtain a digital ID or create a self-signed digital ID in Acrobat or Adobe Reader.Create a self-signed digital IDSelf-signed digital IDs can be adequate for personal use or small-to-medium businesses. Their use should be limited to parties that have established mutual trust.https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/digital-ids.html#create_a_self_signed_digital_idUsing the created digital IDs to sign a PDFhttps://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1812Trusting Self-Signed digital certificateshttps://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1811&nbsp;Using Fill &amp; Sign on non-fillable PDFsAn interactive or fillable form contains fields that you can select or fill in. For such forms, the Fill &amp; Sign tool displays only the Sign option. A flat form does not have interactive fields.

Backup any files on this drive you wish to save or restore. Be sure you select the right drive and partition before encrypting***    Open VeraCrypt and select Create Volume.    In the VeraCrypt Volume Creation choose where you wish the VeraCrypt volume to be created. A VeraCrypt volume can reside in a file, which is also called container, in a partition or drive. For these instructions, choose the second option, Encrypt a non-system partition/drive, and then click Next.    Click on Standard VeraCrypt Volume, then click Next.    Make sure the Never save history option is checked, then click on Select Device.    Select the external drive you wish to encrypt. Make sure you select the &quot;Partition&quot;.    Verify the correct partition is populated, and then click Next.    If you want to delete all of the data on your drive or if the drive is empty, select the Create encrypted volume and format it option. If you want to preserve and encrypt the files on your drive, select the Encrypt partition in place option. Click Next when ready.    ***IMPORTANT: With an attached external drive (e.g., a USB drive), the setup process will delete all existing files on this external drive. Backup any files on this drive you wish to save or restore.***    The default Encryption Algorithm should be AES and the default Hash Algorithm should be SHA-512. If not, change to AES and SHA-512, the click Next.    Verify the Volume Size matches the size of the external drive you are encrypting. You should not be able to modify this. Click Next when are sure you have the right volume selected.    Enter a complex password, which will be used to encrypt the volume. Follow the guidance in this window to help you create a complex password. Click Next after you have entered the password twice.    Select Yes for this screen and then click Next.    Verify the Filesystem is set to exFat. Now move the mouse as randomly as possible within the Volume Creation Wizard window until the Randomness Collected From Mouse Movements indicator becomes green. The longer you move the mouse the better, as this significantly increases the cryptographic strength of the encryption keys. Click Format when ready.    You will receive a final warning about all data being erased on this external drive. Click Yes when ready.    ***IMPORTANT: With an attached external drive (e.g., a USB drive), the setup process will delete all existing files on this external drive. Backup any files on this drive you wish to save or restore.***    The external drive will now begin formatting and encrypting.    Once complete, you may receive this warning. In this example, when the external drive was connected the E: drive was used. Click OK when ready.    The external drive is now encrypted.Mounting Encrypted External Drive    From the main VeraCrypt window select an available drive letter. This will be where the VeraCrypt encrypted external drive will be mounted. Then click on the Select Device button.    Select the partition you used for the setup. In this example we are selecting Partition 1. Click OK when ready.    Confirm the partition you selected is populating. In this example you will see //Device//Harddisk1//Partition1. Once confirmed, click Mount.    Enter the password you used to create the encrypted external drive. Click OK when ready.    Verify the drive you selected is now populated with the encrypted external drive you connected to your computer. Click Exit when ready. You will now see the drive letter selected as a location to copy files.Dismounting the Encrypted External Drive    Select the volume from the list of mounted volumes in the main VeraCrypt window and then click Dismount.    To make files stored on the encrypted external drive accessible again, follow the steps in the Mounting the Encrypted External Drive section.    If you restart Windows or turn off your computer, the encrypted external drive will be also be dismounted.    Regardless of which way the encrypted external drive is dismounted, the files in the encrypted external drive remain encrypted.Veracrypt Container EncryptionCreating an Encrypted File Container    After installing VeraCypt, open and select Create Volume.    In the VeraCrypt Volume Creation choose where you wish the VeraCrypt volume to be created. A VeraCrypt volume can reside in a file, which is also called container, in a partition or drive. For these instructions, choose the first option, Create an encrypted File Container, and then click Next.    Select Standard VeraCrypt volume and then click Next. As the option is selected by default, you can just click Next.    Select where the VeraCrypt volume (file container) is to be created. Note that a VeraCrypt container is like any normal file and can be moved and deleted. Click Select File.    In this example, we will create the VeraCrypt volume in the folder F://Data// and the filename of the volume (container) will be &quot;My Volume&quot;.            You may choose any other filename and location based on your situation (e.g., on a USB Drive). Please note the file My Volume does not exist &ndash; VeraCrypt will create this volume as part of this setup.        IMPORTANT: If you select an existing file, this file will be overwritten by VeraCrypt and replaced with a newly created volume.        Select the desired path (where you wish the container to be created) in the file selector (for example, F://Data).        Type the desired container file name (for example, My Volume) in the File name box and then click Save.                         In the Volume Location window, click Next.        The default Encryption Algorithm should be AES and the default Hash Algorithm should be SHA-512. If not, change to AES and SHA-512, the click Next.        Enter this size of the VeraCrypt container. This window informs you how much space is available. Click Next when ready.        Enter a complex password, which will be used to encrypt the volume. Follow the guidance in this window to help you create a complex password. Select Next after you have entered the password twice.        Move the mouse as randomly as possible within the Volume Creation Wizard window until the Randomness Collected From Mouse Movements indicator becomes green. The longer you move the mouse the better, as this significantly increases the cryptographic strength of the encryption keys. /t/tClick Formatwhen ready.        VeraCrypt will now create a file called  My Volume in the folder F://Data. This file will be a VeraCrypt container (it will contain the encrypted VeraCrypt volume). The following box will appear once the encrytion is complete:        The VeraCrypt volume (file container) has now been successfully created. Click Exit.        Refer to the Mounting the Encrypted File Container steps to begin using this created encrypted file container.        Mounting an Encrypted File Container            From the main VeraCrypt window select a drive letter. This will be the drive letter the VeraCrypt container is mounted. For this example, the M drive has been selected. You will choose any available drive letter.        Click Select File.        Browse to the container file you previously created (e.g., My Volume), clock on the file, and then select Open.        Next, click Mount.        Enter the Password you provided during the setup process. Then Select the PRF algorithm used during the creation of the volume (SHA-512 is the default PRF used by VeraCrypt).                    If you do not remember which PRF was used, select Autodetection. Select OK when ready. VeraCrypt will now attempt to mount the volume.                        The virtual disk has now been successfully mounted. In this example the M Drive has been mounted. The virtual disk is entirely encrypted (including file names, allocation tables, free space, etc.). /t/tYou can now save, copy, or move files to this virtual disk and they will be encrypted. /t/tWhen accessing a file on the mounted volume you will not be asked for the password again. You can open the mounted volume by selecting it on the list as shown in the screenshot below (blue selection) and then double-clicking on the selected item.        You can also browse to the mounted volume the way you normally browse to any other types of volumes. Copy files/folder to and from the VeraCrypt volume as you would with any normal drive.        Dismounting an Encrypted File Container            Select the volume from the list of mounted volumes in the main VeraCrypt window and then click Dismount. To make files stored on the volume accessible again, follow the steps in the Mounting the Encrypted File Container section.        If you restart Windows or turn off your computer, the volume will be also be dismounted.        Regardless of which way the volume is dismounted, the files in the encrypted container remain encrypted.

The table below describes the assistance they can provide you during the setup of your equipment.&nbsp;&nbsp;                                    Activity                                    Description                                                    Racking                                    ITS will work with you to physically install your equipment in racks within the data center. If you have requested combo locks for your racks, ITS will acquire and install these.                                                    Power                                    A standard power configuration is defined in this SLA. If you have power needs beyond these standards, ITS will try to meet them. Of course, ITS will be limited by the constraints of its data center facilities and equipment.            &nbsp;            Please note it is possible that future co-location rates may be based, in part, upon the power configuration of your rack. If this occurs, your requests for additional power may result in your co-location fees being raised in the future. (As stated earlier in the SLA, ITS will review rates annually and will communicate changes to the rates well in advance to all customers.)

    "question": "Virtual Server: ITS Customer Backup Policy (non-ITS Backup Solution)",
    "answer": "This is a summary of the ITS Customer Backup Policy if customers  choose NOT to have their servers backed up by ITS and have their own  backup solution. ITS now requires backups for all Virtual Servers. For customers seeking a backup solution outside of ITS, these are the required guidelines.What  are the guidelines for customers who do not want to use enterprise  backup (ie. backup to an external drive connected to a user&rsquo;s desktop)?        The customer should first determine what kind of Institutional Data will be backed up.                     If data is Public or Restricted, then the following are RECOMMENDED.                         If data is Sensitive or Regulated, then the following are REQUIRED.                                                                                                                                                        Ensure Regular Automated Backups:            Ensure that all system data is automatically backed up on a regular basis. (CIS Control 10.1)                            Example: Daily incremental backups with one full backup, and 30 day retention, depending on your data retention storage policy.                                                                Perform Complete System Backups:            Ensure  that all of the organization's key systems are backed up as a complete  system, through processes such as imaging, to enable the quick recovery  of an entire system. (CIS Control 10.2)                            Example: Backup all data as well as application configuration files to ensure a quicker recovery.                                                                Protect Backups:            Ensure  that backups are properly protected via physical security or encryption  when they are stored, as well as when they are moved across the  network. This includes remote backups and cloud services. (CIS Control  10.4)                            Backups should be BOTH physically secured and encrypted.                                                                Ensure Backups Have At least One Non-Continuously Addressable Destination:            Ensure  that all backups have at least one backup destination that is not  continuously addressable through operating system calls. (CIS Control  10.5)                            The backup destination should not be a device on an  open network, and it should be properly secured via permissions and  access controls.                                            Example backup scenario if NOT choosing backups from ITS                    Purchase an additional virtual server and set it up as a storage repository for backups.                        The backup solution should have a means of encrypting data in transit and in storage for sensitive or regulated data.                                An SSL certificate may need to be obtained, depending on how the backup solution works.                                            Purchase a physical device or server that is meant for backups (i.e., a NAS unit).                                ITS does not provide support with setting up physical devices, the customer will need to contact the vendor.                                    Customer  will need to ensure the device can be secured and protected physically  and over the network (i.e., access control rules).                                    Minimum security standards still apply.                                    What if a customer decides to backup to the cloud (Google, AWS, etc.)?        The  customer will be responsible for vetting third-party risk and  constructing backup services that meet the minimum security standards  and backup requirements, as applicable.&nbsp;            Consult with Data Governance (https://datagov.intranet.hawaii.edu/) before using a third-party cloud backup service.                    The additional Data Governance requirements for&nbsp;third-party IT services will also be required for the customer to complete.

    "question": "Virtual Server: How to Protect Your Server with Duo MFA for Remote Desktop (Windows)",
    "answer": "Before installing and configuring Duo MFA, please ensure you have accounts created on your server matching UH username accounts. Duo MFA will be configured to push on UH usernames, so any username that does not match an existing UH username (i.e., &quot;admin&quot; or &quot;user&quot;) could fail, thus locking you out of your server.&nbsp;    Please also note that using variations of your username (i.e. &quot;jdoe&quot; vs &quot;johndoe&quot;) for the server account that does not match your own username could potentially lock another person out of using Duo MFA, if they have that as an existing UH username.    &nbsp;    Email itscs@hawaii.edu to inform  us that you'd like to setup Duo MFA on your Windows server, and we  will add your server to our Duo environment. Please verify that you are enrolled in Duo MFA. See Getting setup for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for more information.        Please include the following information in your request:        Hostname or VM name    IP address        NOTE: This is only provided to virtual server customers hosted under ITS Managed Services.        &nbsp;    We will filedrop you three keys, which are required in the Duo configuration on the server.        Integration key    Secret key    API hostname        We will also filedrop you the Duo installer for Windows.    &nbsp;    Before you begin with the installation, please ensure that a local account matching your exact UH username has been created on the server. Duo MFA will be configured to push on UH usernames, so any username that does not match an existing UH username (i.e., &quot;admin&quot; or &quot;user&quot;) could fail, thus locking you out of the server.        Please also note that using variations of your username (i.e. &quot;jdoe&quot; vs &quot;johndoe&quot;) for the server account that does not match your own username could potentially lock another person out of using Duo MFA, if they have that as an existing UH username.    &nbsp;    On your Windows server, copy the Duo installer on to the desktop and run it. Be sure to run as Administator.    &nbsp;    At the welcome screen, click Next.                &nbsp;    Paste the API hostname that was filedropped to you in the field. Leave the checkbox unchecked.                &nbsp;    &nbsp;    Copy and paste in both the Integration Key and Secret Key from the filedrop.                &nbsp;    You can leave the following checked as default and proceed to the next step, or change it based on your preference.         Note that you may want to uncheck&nbsp;option two to NOT use the auto push if you use other devices aside from the mobile Duo app to authenticate (like a USB key). This will let you chose the device of your choice to send the push to.        If you have access to your server/VM through the vCenter console, the &quot;only prompt for Duo authentication via RDP&quot; option can be checked so the MFA push won't be enabled when logging into the server through vCenter.                    &nbsp;    Leave the next part unchecked as default and click Next to proceed.                &nbsp;    Leave this part unchecked as the default and click Next.                &nbsp;    Click Install to start the installation. After it finishes, you may need to reboot your server. Login to the server again via RDP to ensure the Duo push does work.&nbsp;"

    "question": "ITS Service Level Agreement - Virtual Server Hosting Service",
    "answer": "DescriptionThe Virtual Server Hosting Service provides the UH community with access to virtual servers running a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or a Microsoft Windows operating system. ITS utilizes a VMware cluster for the provisioning of the virtual servers. The size/configuration of the virtual servers can change over time as needs change.&nbsp;Show StoppersThere are some scenarios where this service will not be appropriate.&nbsp; Below are some examples:    This service may&nbsp;not&nbsp;be used where PCI compliance is required.    &nbsp;    Hardware requirements for peripherals such as sound cards.            A colocation request may have to be considered instead.        &nbsp;            Operating systems that are not ITS-supported (i.e. Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.)    &nbsp;    This limitation is due to our need to provide monthly auditing of OS patching.    &nbsp;    Firewall rules that are deemed to be a security risk by the ITS TI-Security team.            I.e. Open MySQL to the world.        BenefitsInfrastructure Benefits    The environmentally hardened IT Center Data Center can reduce the risk of your equipment being damaged or unavailable due to natural disasters.    &nbsp;    Efficient power and cooling reduces UH&rsquo;s use of natural resources and overall expenses.    &nbsp;    Highly redundant components; reliable power and cooling will increase the uptime of your hosted applications.    &nbsp;    Continue to have full control to your system without worries about buying, installing, supporting or replacing hardware.Hosted Virtual Server Benefits    New servers can be set-up within a few days so you no longer have to go through long procurement processes to get your equipment.    &nbsp;    Can grow or shrink your virtual server over time; ensures you don&rsquo;t spend too much money by over-configuring your systems.            Caveats include:                    Shrinking disk on on Windows is generally not recommended.

Links to policies can be found at https://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/policies/    Ensure that the appropriate firewall rules are specified.    Ensure that a backup strategy for institutional data protection is planned from the outset.AdministrativeYou must:    Identify at least one full-time staff as the virtual server's system administrator.            Ensure that at least one full-time staff member is assigned system and application administration responsibilities. Students cannot be the primary system administrator.        Let ITS know in a timely fashion when changes to personnel are necessary, for example, when a designated system administrator leaves your department.        It is highly recommended that you have a backup system administrator assigned to your virtual server.        &nbsp;            When requesting additional CPUs for example, ensure that any associated increases in application licensing costs are appropriately addressed.            E.G.: An increase in CPU resources might required increase Microsoft SQL Server costs.        &nbsp;            If requesting ITS backups            Install the ITS backup client (see reference section at the end of this document).&nbsp;&nbsp;        Ensure that you have purchased sufficient disk space for your backups.        &nbsp;            Annually confirm the virtual server registration in the InfoSec Server Registration database (you will receive an email reminder).            For more information: https://hawaii.edu/askus/1312.        &nbsp;            Make the requested annual payment to ITS for resources utilized.Data ProtectionEnsure your familiarity with and comprehension&nbsp;of the following:    The UH Information Security Program: https://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/infosecprogram/.    Protecting Sensitive Information at UH: https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1266.    Know and understand the data classification that is applicable to the data being stored and accessed on the virtual server https://datagov.intranet.hawaii.edu/institutional-data-classification-levels/.    Inform ITS in advance when planning to host protected information (HIPAA, FERPA, PCI, PII, etc) on the virtual server.    Properly manage information by assigning at least one full-time staff member as a protected data compliance officer.    Implement a backup strategy to protect institutional data.SecurityMaintaining the security of your virtual servers is the customer responsibility. The customer should make sure software is patched, malware is blocked, passwords are secure and access lists are managed. If for some reason you experience a virtual server compromise, and it becomes a threat to the greater UH community (e.g. it is being used as a host to attack other services), ITS reserves the right to block its network traffic. If this occurs, ITS will notify you immediately.&nbsp;University guidelines and general best practices for securing the hosted virtual servers&nbsp;according to established policies are available here: http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1266.    Manage the applications, administer user access, etc.    Perform monthly (minimally) OS patching utilizing the UH patch servers to ensure that OS patching activities are auditable.    Mitigate critical application vulnerabilities in a timely fashion (within 7 calendar days is recommended).    Ensure continued compliance with Minimum Security Standards for Virtual Server and all Desktops and devices that may connect to the Server https://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/minimum-standards/.    Proactively upgrade your Operating System before it is End of Service Life (EOSL).            ITS will contact the server administrator on record when systems are becoming EOSL. It is the administrator's reponsiblity to respond in a timely manner and work on upgrading to server. Failure to upgrade will leave your OS vulnerable. ITS reserves the right to shut down or block from the network.        PoliciesITS will continue to ensure that security remains a priority, and will verify ongoing compliance to executive policies. Examples of such policies regarding security and data handling would be&nbsp;EP 2.210&nbsp;(Information Technology Resources Policy),&nbsp;EP 2.214&nbsp;(Institutional Data Classification &amp; Information Security Guidelines) &amp;&nbsp;EP 2.215&nbsp;(Protected Data).&nbsp;Excerpt from EP 2.214&quot;3. &nbsp; &nbsp;As stated in Executive Policy EP2.215, Information Technology Services (ITS) has the full authority to enforce technical measures to ensure the security and confidentiality of protected data that are stored or transmitted, whether intentionally or unintentionally, on University systems and networks, including but not limited to immediate disconnection of compromised systems and devices from the University network.4. &nbsp; &nbsp;ITS has the authority to conduct network and device scanning to identify security weaknesses in any University information system, device, or network that may compromise sensitive information or the operations and availability of institutional services.&nbsp; &nbsp; ITS also has the authority to require all servers operating on the University network be regularly scanned for sensitive information, vulnerabilities and be protected in accordance with appropriate data security guidelines based on data classification categories.5. &nbsp; &nbsp;To better protect the University&rsquo;s Institutional Data, ITS may require departments/units/programs to periodically report on the data element/records that they manage. Reporting requirements administered by ITS include PII and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) surveys and server registrations.The PII survey is part of an HRS &sect;487N-7 requirement where UH must annually prepare a report describing the information systems that contain personal information. ITS is responsible for submitting this report and maintains a secure online system for units to report such systems.

Availability &amp; Response TimesVM Hosting Service    Operational 24x7Virtual Server Requests    Requests are usually processed during normal business hours.    Most new virtual server&nbsp;requests should receive a reply within 2 business days.    Most new virtual server support requests should receive a reply within 8 business hours.Storage Requests    RHEL            By default all storage is allocated to &quot;//&quot;.        If slow and fast disk are allocated, there will be one filesystem each.            Windows            By default the system disk is allocated to &quot;C:&quot;.        By default the data disk is allocated as the next available drive.            Requests to expand storage are processed during normal business hours.    Requests should receive a reply within 2 business days.    On Windows removing storage is okay only if the entire disk is deleted. VMware doesn't support decreasing disk allocation size, e.g., decrease a 100GB disk to 75GB.Firewall RequestsFirewall requests are subject to review and approval by the TI security team.    Requests are usually processed during normal business hours.    Most firewall configuration requests should receive a reply within 2 business days.    By default all traffic is blocked incoming to virtual servers and are behind a firewall.    By default all traffic is open outgoing from a virtual server.Note:&nbsp;the default the firewall configuration is very restrictive.&nbsp; For example, requests to register a CAS URL will result in troubleshooting to figure out why CAS is not working and it will be determined that the firewall configuration must be adjusted.Backup/RestoresNote that file-level backups are performed when using the ITS backup solution. One implication is that only database exports are useful for backups. When requesting backups you will have the opportunity to indicate which directories are to be included.

    "question": "TEN-DIGIT DIALING at UH",
    "answer": "Effective October 24, 2021The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has adopted 988 as a new three-digit number to be used nationwide to reach the National Suicide Prevention and Mental Health Crisis Lifeline starting July 16, 2022. This will work similarly to dialing 911 to reach Emergency Services nation wide.&nbsp;In order for 988 to work, 10-digit local dialing will be mandatory. Starting October 24, 2021, all local calls, including those on the same island, will require that you dial area code 808 + telephone number.Who is affected:Anyone with an area code 808 telephone number will need to make a change from 7-digit local dialing to 10-digit local dialing.How does this affect UH:    On campus dialing (for example 5-digit extension dialing at Manoa, 4-digit extension dialing at Hawaii CC, KCC, UH Hilo, West Oahu and 3 digits at HCC, Kauai CC, LCC, Maui College, WCC ) will remain unchanged. &nbsp;    9+7-digit dialing will still work from all UH campuses within the 808 prefix EXCEPT for calls to 808-988-xxxx (Manoa) which will require 9+10-digits. For consistency and to eliminate erroneous calls to the Lifeline, it is recommended that users adopt 9+10-digit dialing for all US numbers including to 9+808+telephone number from your campus phone.&nbsp;    Check with your alarm company to make necessary adjustments to any programmed 808 prefix number to dial to 9+808+telephone number.    Review the numbers stored in your fax machine and convert the stored numbers to 10-digits (9+808+telephone number). Refer to your fax machine guide for programming assistance.    Re-program your auto dial keys to 9+10-digits. &nbsp;To change your auto dial:            Click on the AutoDial key.        Enter 9+808+telephone number for all 808 prefix numbers        Press the AutoDial key to save.            &nbsp;To call forward your line:            Press Forward        Enter 9+808+telephone number for all 808 prefix numbers        Press Forwar(d) to save            Change your Reach Me number to 808+telephone number.    Change your Notify me number to 808+telephone number.    Review your websites, letterheads, e-signatures, etc. for any 7-digit telephone number references and update them to 10-digits. &nbsp;&nbsp;For additional information:https://www.hawaiiantel.com/Residential/Support/Home-Phone-Support/Home-Phone-Support-Dial-808https://www.verizon.com/about/news/new-dialing-procedure-82-area-codes-36-stateshttps://mobile.spectrum.com/support/article/360056951191/new-mandatory-10digit-dialing-procedureshttps://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/ten-digit-dialing&nbsp;If you have any questions or concerns, please call ITS Telecommunications at 808-956-6033 or email us at telecom@hawaii.edu&nbsp;"

    "question": "Virtual Server: Dual-Homed to Single-Homed Network Conversion (Windows)",
    "answer": "SUMMARY:In the past, virtual servers were provisioned with both a public and a private network (&quot;dual-homed&quot;). ITS will be removing the use to the private network, and self-managed VM customers will need to complete the following steps to remove the private network on their server.NOTE: You should contact itscs@hawaii.edu at least 1-2 business days before you plan this, as modifying the private network may cause a downtime to other services or hosts that your server connects to. ITS may also need to modify additional firewall rules on your VM, so if you have critical services that need to be up, it is best that you coordinate this with us ahead of time.&nbsp;    Go the the Control Panel on the server and edit the public network interface, which should have a 128.171.*.* IP address.    &nbsp;    Change the DNS servers to the following:        192.168.10.115    192.168.10.116    &nbsp;    Open the command prompt (cmd) to remove the static routes that were set up on the server. Run &quot;netstat -r&quot; to confirm the following routes show:        &nbsp;    Enter the following commands to remove each route:        route -p delete 10.0.0.0    route -p delete 172.16.0.0    route -p delete 192.168.0.0    &nbsp;    Go back to the Control Panel and disable the private network interface, which should have an IP of 172.17.*.*    &nbsp;    Email itscs@hawaii.edu that you have disabled the private network and removed the static routes. We will then remove the NIC from the VM, and modify additional firewall rules on our end if needed.        Please note that if the server needs to connect to critical services, this part may not work unless we modify the firewall rules. Therefore, it would be best if we are contacted during business hours to ensure this is completed.&nbsp;RELATED ARTICLES:    Virtual Server: Dual-Homed to Single-Homed Network Conversion (Linux) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"

    "question": "Virtual Server: Dual-Homed to Single-Homed Network Conversion (Linux)",
    "answer": "SUMMARY:In the past, virtual servers were provisioned with both a public and a  private network (&quot;dual-homed&quot;). ITS will be removing the use to the  private network, and self-managed VM customers will need to complete the  following steps to remove the private network on their server.NOTE: You should contact itscs@hawaii.edu at least 1-2  business days before you plan this, as modifying the private network may  cause a downtime to other services or hosts that your server connects  to. ITS may also need to modify additional firewall rules on your VM, so  if you have critical services that need to be up, it is best that you  coordinate this with us ahead of time.You may also request for a snapshot of the server first to allow us to revert back in case a file is deleted or modified in error.&nbsp;    As the root user, run the &quot;ifconfig&quot; command. You should get an output similar to the following.         # ifconfig    eno16780032: flags=4163&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt;&nbsp; mtu 1500    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inet 166.122.3.161&nbsp; netmask 255.255.255.0&nbsp; broadcast 166.122.3.255    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inet6 fe80::250:56ff:feb0:2ddd&nbsp; prefixlen 64&nbsp; scopeid 0x20&lt;link&gt;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ether 00:50:56:b0:2d:dd&nbsp; txqueuelen 1000&nbsp; (Ethernet)    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RX packets 1185&nbsp; bytes 102807 (100.3 KiB)    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RX errors 0&nbsp; dropped 0&nbsp; overruns 0&nbsp; frame 0    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TX packets 198&nbsp; bytes 23317 (22.7 KiB)    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TX errors 0&nbsp; dropped 0 overruns 0&nbsp; carrier 0&nbsp; collisions 0        ens224: flags=4163&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt;&nbsp; mtu 1500    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inet 172.17.36.14&nbsp; netmask 255.255.255.0&nbsp; broadcast 172.17.36.255    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inet6 fe80::250:56ff:feb0:5673&nbsp; prefixlen 64&nbsp; scopeid 0x20&lt;link&gt;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ether 00:50:56:b0:56:73&nbsp; txqueuelen 1000&nbsp; (Ethernet)    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RX packets 689&nbsp; bytes 146959 (143.5 KiB)    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RX errors 0&nbsp; dropped 0&nbsp; overruns 0&nbsp; frame 0    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TX packets 688&nbsp; bytes 89245 (87.1 KiB)    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TX errors 0&nbsp; dropped 0 overruns 0&nbsp; carrier 0&nbsp; collisions 0        lo: flags=73&lt;UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING&gt;&nbsp; mtu 65536    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inet 127.0.0.1&nbsp; netmask 255.0.0.0    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inet6 ::1&nbsp; prefixlen 128&nbsp; scopeid 0x10&lt;host&gt;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loop&nbsp; txqueuelen 1&nbsp; (Local Loopback)    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RX packets 0&nbsp; bytes 0 (0.0 B)    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RX errors 0&nbsp; dropped 0&nbsp; overruns 0&nbsp; frame 0    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TX packets 0&nbsp; bytes 0 (0.0 B)    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TX errors 0&nbsp; dropped 0 overruns 0&nbsp; carrier 0&nbsp; collisions 0        Note the highlighted line above with &quot;ens224&quot; and the highlighted IP address as a 172.17.*.* IP. This indicates that &quot;ens224&quot; is the private network interface, and your server may have a different name such as &quot;eth1&quot;. Ensure the IP address starts with &quot;172.17.*.*&quot;, which indicates that it's a private IP.    &nbsp;    Edit the /etc/resolv.conf file using the command &quot;vi /etc/resolv.conf&quot;        Change the &quot;nameservers&quot; lines to use 192.168.10.115 and 192.168.10.116 like in the example below:                Save the file and exit.    &nbsp;    Delete the following file: /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-&lt;name&gt;, where &lt;name&gt; is the name of the private network interface from the &quot;ifconfig&quot; command&quot;. For example, &quot;rm /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1&quot;        WARNING: Be sure to check if the file does contain the private IP first or you may be accidentally deleting the public IP!    &nbsp;    Delete the following file: /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-&lt;name&gt;, where &lt;name&gt; is the name of the private network interface from the &quot;ifconfig&quot; command&quot;. For example, &quot;rm /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-eth1&quot; if the interface's name is &quot;eth1&quot;    &nbsp;    Edit /etc/sysconfig/network and ensure the gateway points to the gateway IP of the public network. If you are not sure what the public gateway is, email itscs@hawaii.edu. Example below of the file referring to the public gateway and the public network interface, eth0:                &nbsp;    Email itscs@hawaii.edu that you have disabled the private network and removed the static routes. We will then remove the NIC from the VM, and modify additional firewall rules on our end if needed.        Once we've confirmed removing the NIC from the VM, restart the VM and SSH back in. If you are unable to use SSH, access the VM from the vCenter console.        Please note that if the server needs to connect to critical services, this part may not work unless we modify the firewall rules. Therefore, it would be best if we are contacted during business hours to ensure this is completed.

    "question": "Google@UH Storage Limitations and Quotas",
    "answer": "In 2021, Google announced a new storage policy which will move our Google domain from unlimited storage to pooled storage across all Google@UH accounts by July 2024. This means that each Google@UH account&rsquo;s use of Gmail, Drive, and Photos, in addition to all Google@UH shared drives, will collectively count towards our Google domain&rsquo;s pooled storage. Should our collective storage use exceed our allotted pooled storage amount, some Google@UH services may be limited. In response to Google&rsquo;s announcement, we looked at storage use for all Google@UH accounts and shared drives and identified some inappropriate use of the storage for Google@UH services.&nbsp;As a result of Google&rsquo;s change to pooled storage, as well as the discovery of some misuse of Google@UH resources, changes to Google@UH services will be made over the upcoming year to help manage the amount of our pooled storage being used.&nbsp;From Wednesday, February 1, 2023 to Monday, January 29, 2024, all Google@UH accounts will have storage quotas defined based on an individual&rsquo;s affiliation with UH, with no service impact if the quota is reached or exceeded. This one-year non-enforcement period is being provided to allow individuals time to bring their Google@UH account and shared drive storage usage under the appropriate quota before Google@UH services become impacted.&nbsp;After Monday, January 29, 2024, storage quota enforcement will begin, with service impact for Google@UH accounts when the quota is reached or exceeded until storage use is brought back below the account quota.&nbsp;    Individual Google@UH account storage quotas    Google@UH Shared Drive limitations and storage quotas    FAQs&nbsp;Individual Google@UH account storage quotasIndividual Google@UH accounts will have the following storage quota based on their affiliation/status. Quotas will be enforced starting on 1/29/2024. &nbsp;                        Affiliation            Quota (in GB*)                            Faculty / Emeritus Faculty            100 GB                            Staff            100 GB                            Students            25 GB                            Prestudents            10 GB                            Affiliates / Retirees            25 GB                            Departmental/Organizational Usernames            25 GB                            Ohana            7.5 GB            &nbsp;*1GB = 1000MB&nbsp;Users who have multiple affiliations will have storage quota based on whichever affiliation has the highest allocation. Storage quotas for these users will not be the sum of quotas for all of their affiliations. For example, a user who is both a faculty member and a student will have a storage quota based on their faculty affiliation (100 GB) as their faculty quota provides a higher allocation when compared with their student quota.&nbsp;Google@UH Shared Drive limitations and storage quotasAs of January 2023,&nbsp;Shared Drives created within Google Drive will have the following limitations and storage quotas.&nbsp;    Google@UH shared drives can only be created by UH faculty and staff using their Google@UH accounts. Other Google@UH account collaborators can continue to be granted an appropriate role within a shared drive, they just cannot request or create the shared drives themselves.    Newly created Google@UH shared drives have been limited to 25 GB of storage quota. Once this quota is reached, files within the shared drive will remain available, but new files will not be able to be stored in the shared drive.    Beginning on 4/1/2023,&nbsp;we will also be identifying and applying the same 25GB storage quota to existing shared drives that are well below this limit.&nbsp;FAQs    What counts towards my&nbsp;storage quota?

It is recommended that you use this time to review and reduce your storage usage to bring you under your quota.Once enforcement begins after 1/29/2024 the following services will be impacted should you exceed your storage quota and will remain in place until your storage use falls below your quota:    You will not be able to upload new files or images to Google Drive.    You will not be able to create files in collaborative content creation apps, such as Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, Drawings, Forms, and Jamboard. Until you reduce your storage usage, you will not be able to edit or copy affected files or submit forms.    You will not be able to back up any photos or videos to Google Photos.    You will not be able to record new meetings in Google Meet.    You will not be able to create assignments with new files, export grades to Google sheets, or make copies of Assignments in Google Classroom.The following services will still be available to you even if you have exceeded your storage quota:    You will still be able to sign in.

Items that commonly utilize more storage space include large files (videos, music, software installers, etc.), high resolution or raw photos, docs/sheets/slides with images embedded, and emails with large attachments. In general, individual emails without attachments and small docs/sheets/slides without images utilize comparatively little storage space.&nbsp;I deleted emails, files, or photos but my storage use has not decreased. Am I doing something wrong?When you first delete an email, file, or photo it will be moved to the &quot;trash&quot;. Emails, files, and photos in trash continue to count against your storage quota until permanently deleted. The Gmail, Drive, and Photos apps each have their own, individual trash. While in your trash, items can be recovered within 30 days. Items in trash are automatically and permanently deleted after 30 days. You can also choose to manually and permanently delete items in your trash at any time by navigating to the &quot;trash&quot; folder and clicking either &quot;Empty Trash&quot; to remove all items in trash or by selecting individual items and selecting &quot;Delete Forever&quot;.&nbsp;Please note that emails, files, and photos that are permanently deleted from trash are irrecoverable. This applies whether they were manually deleted from the trash or automatically deleted after the 30-day window. If you choose to manually delete emails, files, or photos from trash, please be absolutely certain that you no longer need them.If you delete, restore, or permanently delete a large number of files or folders at once, it may take several minutes for the changes to be processed.&nbsp;I have emails, files, photos that I want to keep but I still need to lower my storage use. What options are available to me?You can download a copy of emails, files, and photos prior to deleting them. Once you have a copy stored on your local computer, external storage media, or another cloud storage account, you can delete the emails, files, or photos from your Google@UH account to free up storage space.

Then, delete the photos from your hawaii.edu account. Remember, you need to empty your Google Photos' Trash in order to reclaim storage space used by deleted photos.&nbsp;How do I request an exception to increase my storage quota?As we are not yet enforcing storage quotas, we are not currently offering quota increases or exceptions. We will provide more information on how to request increases to your quota prior to enforcement. In the meantime, we strongly encourage users to use the non-enforcement period to review, evaluate, and shrink their storage usage. If you have any questions or concerns about your storage usage, please contact the ITS Help Desk.&nbsp;I manage a Departmental or Organizational UH Username. Do these types of accounts have storage quotas?Yes, Departmental and Organizational UH Usernames have a 25 GB storage quota. See the individual Google@UH account storage quota table above for a full list of storage quotas by affiliation/status.&nbsp;Does the Shared Drive storage count against my individual storage quota?No, Shared Drives have their own storage quotas and storage used by a Shared Drive does not count towards an individual's storage quota. Storage used by Shared Drives does count towards our Google domain's total pooled storage limit. See below for information on reviewing the storage usage of a Shared Drive.&nbsp;How do I check the current storage usage of a Shared Drive?First navigate to the list of Shared Drives that you manage or are a member of by visiting&nbsp;https://drive.google.com/drive/shared-drives.

Proofpoint automatically evaluates all incoming email and protects against spam, malware, phishing, spoofing, and enforces other content policies for the University. Email messages that are evaluated as spam will be delivered to a user&rsquo;s personal quarantine for their review instead of being sent directly to their inbox. This personal quarantine serves as an additional layer of defense while still providing users with the control to manage the emails that Proofpoint is filtering. Each user/account has their own personal quarantine. Users will be notified of new messages in their personal quarantine via a daily digest sent by email. Users can also review messages in their personal quarantine at any time by visiting the quarantine web portal. Messages stored in a user&rsquo;s personal quarantine will be automatically deleted after 30 days.&nbsp;Note: to better protect users, Proofpoint will block highly malicious types of email (phishing, malware, etc.) before ever reaching a user&rsquo;s personal quarantine or inbox and, thus, users will be unable to interact with these more dangerous types of messages.&nbsp;Quarantine Daily DigestUsers will receive a daily digest that will provide a list of any new emails that have been placed in their personal quarantine within the last 24 hours. These daily digests will be delivered to users every day at 7:00 AM. Emails in a user&rsquo;s personal quarantine are organized into spam or low priority (unsolicited invitations, newsletters, etc.) categories. From the emailed daily digest, users can review the sender, subject, and sent date/time of an email and can perform quick actions to release an email to their inbox or add a sender to their personal safe list. From the daily digest, users can also quickly pivot to the email quarantine web portal to further manage their personal quarantine.&nbsp;Quarantine Web PortalThe quarantine web portal provides users with additional tools to manage their quarantine. In the web portal, users can    view full email details including the body of a message,    view all emails still stored in their quarantine,    add or remove senders to or from their safe and block lists,    delete emails stored in their quarantine,    modify their daily digest preferences.    &nbsp;Spam vs. Low PriorityQuarantined email in both the daily digest and web portal will be organized into two categories: Spam and Low Priority. In the daily digest, separate tables for Spam and Low Priority (with one email per row) will be presented to users. In the web portal, users will need to navigate between the Spam and Low Priority folders using the left-hand folder navigation menu.SpamSpam emails, sometimes referred to as &ldquo;junk emails&rdquo;, are unsolicited email messages. Often these messages are sent in bulk and will contain advertisements or will be commercial in nature. Spammers obtain email addresses from compromised websites or email lists, by harvesting compromised users&rsquo; address books, or by buying/trading address lists with other malicious actors. Some spam messages are not only annoying, but potentially harmful - used as a mechanism to direct users to malicious websites, broadly drop malicious programs or files as attachments, or con/scam users out of money.Low PriorityLow Priority emails are often newsletters, invitations, or announcements from companies or services that users may have knowingly or unknowingly signed up for. Sometimes services that users sign up for may not inform users that they will be adding them to mailing lists or may share a user&rsquo;s email address with other businesses without plainly stating it to users at the time of sign-up. What is considered wanted or unwanted low priority email may differ from user to user, so it may be prudent to more carefully review messages quarantined as low priority.&nbsp;Turning On Restrictive (Spam and Low Priority) FilteringBy default, only spam filtering is turned on. To also turn on &quot;low priority&quot; message filtering:    Access your personal quarantine.    Click on Profile (bottom left hand column). In My Settings, under What type of spam detection do you want?, select Restrictive to include &quot;low priority&quot; email message filtering.    Click Save.&nbsp;Accessing Your Personal QuarantineDaily DigestUsers will receive a daily digest to their inbox every day at 7:00 AM if there are any new emails in their personal quarantine. If there are no new emails in their personal quarantine since the last daily digest was sent, users will not receive a scheduled daily digest. Users can also manually request an on-demand digest at any time by visiting any recent daily digest and clicking on the &ldquo;Request On-Demand Quarantine Digest&rdquo; link. The on-demand digest will show any new emails in their personal quarantine since the last daily digest in addition to any emails currently stored in their personal quarantine.Web PortalUsers can access their personal quarantine web portal by visiting quarantine.hawaii.edu (available after Proofpoint's implementation on 5/22/2023).

Email can simply remain in your quarantine until they are deleted after 30 days.Do I need to delete email in my personal quarantine?No, email will be automatically deleted after 30 days. You do not need to manually delete email in your personal quarantine.Can I change the time at which I receive my daily digest?Unfortunately, no. Users cannot specify at which time they will receive the scheduled daily digests. Digests are currently scheduled to be sent at 7:00 AM daily. Alternatively, users can request an on-demand digest at any time or visit the web portal to review their personal quarantine at any time.I can&rsquo;t find a message in my personal quarantine. Where did it go?Emails are only stored in your personal quarantine for 30 days. If the email you&rsquo;re looking for is older than 30 days, it will have been deleted.&nbsp;If you had already released an email from your personal quarantine, you will find it in your inbox or possibly other folders/labels at your Google@UH Gmail (remember, any filters you have configured within your Google@UH gmail will still trigger on matched email released from your quarantine).&nbsp;If you have many messages in your quarantine and are having trouble finding what you're looking for, try searching your quarantine for the sender or a part of the subject by clicking &ldquo;Find&rdquo; in the toolbar of the web portal.Will I see all filtered messages in my personal quarantine?All spam and low priority email quarantined within the last 30 days will be visible in your personal quarantine.&nbsp;To better protect users, proofpoint will block more dangerous or malicious types of email (phishing, malware, etc.) before ever reaching a user&rsquo;s personal quarantine or inbox and thus users will be unable to view or interact with these types of messages.How do I identify my daily digest?You will receive your daily digest every morning at 7:00 AM. Other details of the daily digest are as follows:&nbsp;from: Email Quarantine Daily Digest &lt;noreply@hawaii.edu&gt;to: yourusername@hawaii.edusubject: Email Quarantine Daily Digest: X Total Messages (&lsquo;X&rsquo; representing the number of new messages that have been quarantined since the last daily digest was sent)What&rsquo;s the difference between the &ldquo;Release&rdquo; and &ldquo;Release and Allow Sender&rdquo; actions?&ldquo;Release&rdquo; will release a message from your quarantine to your inbox. &ldquo;Release and Allow Sender&rdquo; will both release a message to your inbox and add the sender of the email to your safe senders list, allowing all future email from that sender to bypass your personal quarantine and always arrive in your inbox.&nbsp;What's the difference between my personal quarantine and my gmail 'Spam' folder?In concept, the two are very similar. However, Proofpoint's personal quarantine adds an additional layer of defense by safely allowing users to review messages before they arrive in their inbox. This can help prevent accidental clicks on advertisements or attachments, the loading of tracking cookies/images, and unintentionally providing data on your activity to third parties.&nbsp;"

Proofpoint automatically evaluates all incoming email and protects against spam, malware, phishing, spoofing, and enforces other content policies for the University. Email messages that are evaluated as spam will be delivered to a user&rsquo;s personal quarantine for their review instead of being sent directly to their inbox. This personal quarantine serves as an additional layer of defense while still providing users with the control to manage the emails that Proofpoint is filtering. Each user/account has their own personal quarantine. Users will be notified of new messages in their personal quarantine via a daily digest sent by email. Users can also review messages in their personal quarantine at any time by visiting the quarantine web portal. Messages stored in a user&rsquo;s personal quarantine will be automatically deleted after 30 days.&nbsp;Note: to better protect users, Proofpoint will block highly malicious types of email (phishing, malware, etc.) before ever reaching a user&rsquo;s personal quarantine or inbox and, thus, users will be unable to interact with these more dangerous types of messages.&nbsp;Quarantine Daily DigestUsers will receive a daily digest that will provide a list of any new emails that have been placed in their personal quarantine within the last 24 hours. These daily digests will be delivered to users every day at 7:00 AM. Emails in a user&rsquo;s personal quarantine are organized into spam or low priority (unsolicited invitations, newsletters, etc.) categories. From the emailed daily digest, users can review the sender, subject, and sent date/time of an email and can perform quick actions to release an email to their inbox or add a sender to their personal safe list. From the daily digest, users can also quickly pivot to the email quarantine web portal to further manage their personal quarantine.&nbsp;Quarantine Web PortalThe quarantine web portal provides users with additional tools to manage their quarantine. In the web portal, users can    view full email details including the body of a message,    view all emails still stored in their quarantine,    add or remove senders to or from their safe and block lists,    delete emails stored in their quarantine,    modify their daily digest preferences.    &nbsp;Spam vs. Low PriorityQuarantined email in both the daily digest and web portal will be organized into two categories: Spam and Low Priority. In the daily digest, separate tables for Spam and Low Priority (with one email per row) will be presented to users. In the web portal, users will need to navigate between the Spam and Low Priority folders using the left-hand folder navigation menu.SpamSpam emails, sometimes referred to as &ldquo;junk emails&rdquo;, are unsolicited email messages. Often these messages are sent in bulk and will contain advertisements or will be commercial in nature. Spammers obtain email addresses from compromised websites or email lists, by harvesting compromised users&rsquo; address books, or by buying/trading address lists with other malicious actors. Some spam messages are not only annoying, but potentially harmful - used as a mechanism to direct users to malicious websites, broadly drop malicious programs or files as attachments, or con/scam users out of money.Low PriorityLow Priority emails are often newsletters, invitations, or announcements from companies or services that users may have knowingly or unknowingly signed up for. Sometimes services that users sign up for may not inform users that they will be adding them to mailing lists or may share a user&rsquo;s email address with other businesses without plainly stating it to users at the time of sign-up. What is considered wanted or unwanted low priority email may differ from user to user, so it may be prudent to more carefully review messages quarantined as low priority.&nbsp;Turning On Restrictive (Spam and Low Priority) FilteringBy default, only spam filtering is turned on. To also turn on &quot;low priority&quot; message filtering:    Access your personal quarantine.    Click on Profile (bottom left hand column). In My Settings, under What type of spam detection do you want?, select Restrictive to include &quot;low priority&quot; email message filtering.    Click Save.&nbsp;Accessing Your Personal QuarantineDaily DigestUsers will receive a daily digest to their inbox every day at 7:00 AM if there are any new emails in their personal quarantine. If there are no new emails in their personal quarantine since the last daily digest was sent, users will not receive a scheduled daily digest. Users can also manually request an on-demand digest at any time by visiting any recent daily digest and clicking on the &ldquo;Request On-Demand Quarantine Digest&rdquo; link. The on-demand digest will show any new emails in their personal quarantine since the last daily digest in addition to any emails currently stored in their personal quarantine.Web PortalUsers can access their personal quarantine web portal by visiting quarantine.hawaii.edu (available after Proofpoint's implementation on 5/22/2023).

How does URL Defense work?    What do rewritten URLs look like?    Are all URLs sent in email rewritten?    How long does URL Defense take to scan a website before sending me to the website?    Do I need to be using a certain device or email client for URL Defense to work?    What if the malicious actor changes the website after the email is delivered to me?    What if a website I visited was identified as malicious and blocked by Proofpoint?What is URL Defense?Proofpoint is the University's email security gateway, providing additional malware, phishing, spam, and targeted attack protection. One of the security features provided by Proofpoint is called URL Defense. URL Defense works by rewriting URLs (web addresses and links) in emails as they pass through our Proofpoint gateway on their way to your inbox. By rewriting URLs, Proofpoint is able to send all &ldquo;clicks&rdquo; of a URL to an isolated sandbox and scan the destination website to ensure it&rsquo;s safe before you visit.How does URL Defense work?Email-based attacks, especially phishing attacks, are often triggered when users click on malicious links (URLs) provided to them in email. Malicious actors often try to imitate the URLs of legitimate websites or hide malicious URLs behind shortened URLs to obfuscate the actual website users will visit upon clicking. The malicious website may closely resemble a login page the user is accustomed to in an attempt to fool even the most vigilant of users into logging in, thereby exposing their credentials and providing the malicious actor with an avenue into the user&rsquo;s email or other systems. The malicious website may have been developed with the intent to exploit browser or OS vulnerabilities and infect the user&rsquo;s device with ransomware, cryptojacks, or other malware. Once infected, malware often scans local networks, hunting for other devices vulnerable to infection - sometimes lying dormant on host devices for hours, days, or weeks to prevent detection - before initializing and executing its attack.This all starts with clicking a link sent via email. URL Defense works by rewriting URLs before they reach your inbox. When a rewritten URL is clicked, URL Defense will open the destination website in a remote sandbox in order to safely scan the website before your visit. If a website is determined to be safe, URL Defense will seamlessly forward you along to the destination website. If the website is determined to be malicious, URL Defense will not send you to the website and will instead display a message to inform you that the site has been blocked and why.What do rewritten URLs look like?In the email body text, a rewritten URL will appear no different from when it was sent. However, when hovering over or inspecting URLs, you will notice that rewritten URLs begin with&nbsp;https://urldefense.com/&hellip;&nbsp;or&nbsp;https://urldefense.proofpointcom/&hellip;&nbsp;This is normal and is an indication that URL Defense will be used to scan the website before your visit.Are all URLs sent in email rewritten?No, the following URLs will not be rewritten:    URLs sent internally (from @hawaii.edu to @hawaii.edu)    URLs that link to known-safe domains or websites    URLs that link to services provided by Proofpoint (proofpoint.com, pphosted.com, urldefense.com, urldefense.proofpoint.com)How long does URL Defense take to scan a website before sending me to the website?The process to sandbox and scan the website usually takes no longer than a few moments and the delay is often unnoticeable.Do I need to be using a certain device or email client for URL Defense to work?No, URL Defense is device and network-agnostic. URL Defense will work to protect you whether you are using Google@UH Gmail on the web, a mail client like Outlook or Thunderbird, or checking your email on your mobile device.What if the malicious actor changes the website after the email is delivered to me?&ldquo;Delayed phishing&rdquo; or &ldquo;post-delivery weaponization&rdquo; is a process where a malicious actor initially sends an email with a link that routes to a harmless website, then later weaponizes the link by redirecting to a malicious site or replacing the harmless website content with malicious content. This is effective in fooling some email protection methods that only scan websites upon email delivery, leaving users who view the email after the link has been weaponized vulnerable.Conversely, URL Defense performs its scans of websites when a link is clicked by a user and thus is still effective in blocking delayed phishing attacks. Regardless of if or when a destination website changes, URL Defense will always scan the website you&rsquo;re about to visit.What if a website I visited was identified as malicious and blocked by Proofpoint?If URL Defense identifies the website you&rsquo;re about to visit as malicious it will send you to an informational page explaining that the website was blocked and why. You will not be directed to the destination website. Blocked pages are automatically reported for analysis and no further action is needed on your part."

    "question": "Departmental Website phpCAS upgrade",
    "answer": "If your PHP application hosted by the UH Departmental Hosted Website Service is using the server provided library phpCAS, a major vulnerability was reported in recent months requiring an update.&nbsp; We have tenatitvely scheduled the update for Monday, July 10, 2023 at 9:00am.&nbsp;The unfortunate part of the security update is that the parameters in the call to initialize phpCAS (phpCAS::client) are different and incompatible with the parameters used in the previous versions.&nbsp; Because of this you'll need two different initialization calls in your code, one to be used up until phpCAS is upgraded, and one to be used after the upgrade.&nbsp;Here's some code you can use to update your application:&nbsp; (code additions are shown in bold)&nbsp;if (version_compare(phpCAS::getVersion(), '1.6.0', '&lt;'))&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;phpCAS::client( CAS_VERSION_2_0, $cas_host, $cas_port, $cas_context );&nbsp;else&nbsp; &nbsp;phpCAS::client( CAS_VERSION_2_0, $cas_host, $cas_port, $cas_context, 'https://www.hawaii.edu' );This code checks the version of phpCAS being used.&nbsp; If older than version 1.6.0, it runs the original phpCAS::client line.&nbsp; If version 1.6.0 or newer, it adds the client service name as the final parameter.&nbsp; The URL used in this parameter (above, 'https://www.hawaii.edu') has the protocol, domain, and port of the page calling the function.&nbsp; So for example, if your website is hosted at https://manoa.hawaii.edu/mysite/, the client service name should be:&nbsp; 'https://manoa.hawaii.edu'.&nbsp;To help you test your site against the new phpCAS library, we have setup test servers where your live php code is using the updated phpCAS library.&nbsp; Finally if you have any questions about the phpCAS upgrade, please contact web support at web-support-l@lists.hawaii.edu&nbsp;Setting up your computer to test the new version of phpCASThe first step is to point your computer's hosts file to the test webserver directly. &nbsp;This is accomplished differently depending on which Operating System you are using.Windows SetupMac SetupLinux SetupWindows SetupOpen your favorite text editor such as Notepad as an administrator (right-click, run as administrator).From your text editor, open up your computer's hosts file. &nbsp;You will find your hosts file here: %systemroot%//system32//drivers//etc//hosts &nbsp;(%systemroot% is usually c://windows// but may be somewhere else if your Windows was set up differently.)If your website is hosted on one of the domains shown below, add the line as shown.&nbsp;

    "question": "'Ohana Google@UH Storage Policy and Quotas",
    "answer": "This AskUs article applies specifically to Google@UH Storage Limitations and Quotas for our 'Ohana users (users who are no longer active students, staff, faculty, or other affiliates). If you are an active student, staff, faculty, or affiliate, please visit&nbsp;https://hawaii.edu/askus/1882 for relevant information on your Google@UH Storage Limitations and Quotas.&nbsp;In 2021, Google announced a new storage policy which will move our Google domain from unlimited storage to pooled storage across all Google@UH accounts. This means that each Google@UH account&rsquo;s use of Gmail, Drive, and Photos, in addition to all Google@UH shared drives, will collectively count towards our Google domain&rsquo;s pooled storage. Should our collective storage use exceed our allotted pooled storage amount, some Google@UH services may be limited. In response to Google&rsquo;s announcement, we reviewed storage use for all Google@UH accounts and shared drives and identified some inappropriate use of the storage for Google@UH services.&nbsp;As a result of Google&rsquo;s change to pooled storage, as well as the discovery of some misuse of Google@UH resources, storage quotas are being instituted for all Google@UH accounts based on an individual&rsquo;s affiliation with UH.&nbsp;'Ohana user accounts (those users who are&nbsp;no longer an active student, staff, faculty, or other affiliate)&nbsp;will have a 7.5 GB storage quota.&nbsp;On Monday, January 29, 2024, storage quotas will start being enforced, with service impact for &lsquo;Ohana user accounts whose storage usage exceeds their 7.5 GB storage quota. Ohana users over their quota after enforcement begins may have their UH Username disabled and all data stored within their Google@UH account deleted (including emails stored in Gmail, documents stored in Drive, calendar and contacts data, etc.). We are notifying &lsquo;Ohana users in advance of this change to provide impacted users with time to bring their Google@UH storage usage within their 7.5 GB storage quota before enforcement begins.&nbsp;FAQs    Can I keep my UH username?    As 'Ohana, what is my storage quota?    How long will I have to reduce my storage usage and bring my usage within my allotted 7.5 GB quota?    What counts towards my&nbsp;storage quota?         How do I check my current storage use?    What happens if I exceed my storage quota?         How do I manage my storage use by deleting emails, files, and photos?         I deleted emails, files, or photos but my storage use has not decreased. Am I doing something wrong?         I have emails, files, photos that I want to keep but I still need to lower my storage use. What options are available to me?    Can I transfer my data to a personal Google account?    Does Shared Drive storage count against my individual storage quota?    How do I delete a Shared Drive?    How do I change the manager of a Shared Drive?Can I keep my UH username and Google@UH account?Once the UH Identity Management System detects that you are no longer affiliated with the University of Hawaii (i.e. you are no longer an active student, staff, faculty, or other affiliate), your UH Username will be given a grace period of 180 days during which time you can enroll in&nbsp;Online Services for 'Ohana&nbsp;to maintain access to your UH Username and Google@UH account.Enrollment in Online Services for 'Ohana must be renewed anually in order to maintain access to your UH Username.Furthermore, 'Ohana users who exceed their alotted 7.5 GB Google@UH storage quota may have their UH Usernames disabled and data stored within their Google@UH accounts deleted.&nbsp;As 'Ohana, what is my storage quota?As an 'Ohana user, your storage quota is 7.5 GB.&nbsp;How long will I have to reduce my storage usage and bring my usage within my allotted 7.5 GB quota?You will have the full duration of your grace period (180 days) after losing your active affiliation to reduce your storage usage and bring your usage within your alloted 7.5 GB quota. To find your grace period's end date, please review the email(s) that were sent to you upon entering your grace period titled &quot;Important Notice - End of access to UH Online Services&quot; or &quot;Confirmation of your UH Ohana request&quot; (for users who had pre-opted into Ohana).&nbsp;What counts towards my&nbsp;storage quota?Gmail    Messages and attachments including items in your Spam and TrashDrive    Most files in your &quot;My Drive,&quot; including PDFs, images, videos, and items in your Trash.

It is recommended that you use this time to review and reduce your storage usage to bring your usage under your 7.5 GB quota.Once enforcement begins after 1/29/2024'Ohana users within their 180-day grace period will see the following impact should their storage quota be exceeded:    You will not be able to upload new files or images to Google Drive.    You will not be able to create files in collaborative content creation apps, such as Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, Drawings, Forms, and Jamboard. Until you reduce your storage usage, you will not be able to edit or copy affected files or submit forms.    You will not be able to back up any photos or videos to Google Photos.    You will not be able to record new meetings in Google Meet.    You will not be able to create assignments with new files, export grades to Google sheets, or make copies of Assignments in Google Classroom.        You will still be able to sign in.    You will still be able to send and receive emails.    You will still be able to view and download files stored on Google Drive.    You will still be able to view and download photos stored on Google Photos.'Ohana users who are no longer within their 180-day grace period may have their UH Usernames disabled and all data stored within their Google@UH accounts deleted&nbsp;(including emails stored in Gmail, documents stored in Drive, calendar and contacts data, etc.).&nbsp;How do I manage my storage use by deleting emails, files, and photos?You can find instructions and tips for finding and deleting emails, files, and photos that are taking up your storage here:&nbsp;https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/11448771.When managing your storage use, it is recommended to review items that are using the most amount of storage space first and work your way down to items using less storage space. Items that commonly utilize more storage space include large files (videos, music, software installers, etc.), high resolution or raw photos, docs/sheets/slides with images embedded, and emails with large attachments. In general, individual emails without attachments and small docs/sheets/slides without images utilize comparatively little storage space.&nbsp;I deleted emails, files, or photos but my storage use has not decreased. Am I doing something wrong?When you first delete an email, file, or photo it will be moved to the &quot;trash&quot;. Gmail, Drive, and Photos all have their own trash. Emails, files, or photos in trash still count against your storage use. Storage in use by items in trash will be reclaimed once the items are permanently deleted. Items in trash are automatically and permanently deleted after 30 days. While in your trash, items can be recovered before the 30-day time window. You can also choose to manually and permanently delete items in your trash at any time by navigating to the &quot;trash&quot; folder and clicking either &quot;Empty Trash&quot; to remove all items in trash or by selecting individual items and selecting &quot;Delete Forever&quot;.&nbsp;Please note that emails, files, and photos that are permanently deleted from trash are irrecoverable. This applies whether they were manually deleted from the trash or automatically deleted after the 30-day time window. If you choose to manually delete emails, files, or photos from trash, please be absolutely certain that you no longer need them.If you delete, restore, or permanently delete a large number of files or folders at once, it might take time for the changes to be processed.&nbsp;I have emails, files, photos that I want to keep but I still need to lower my storage use. What options are available to me?You can download a copy of emails, files, and photos prior to deleting them. Once you have a copy stored on your local computer, external storage media, or another cloud storage account you can delete the emails, files, or photos from your Google@UH account to free up storage space. Google Takeout offers an easy way to obtain a copy of Gmail, Drive, and Photo data but you must be enrolled in&nbsp;Google@UH Consumer Apps&nbsp;to access Takeout.Gmail    Google Takeout (available for users enrolled in&nbsp;Google@UH Consumer Apps)    Archive email via IMAP&nbsp;using ThunderbirdDrive    Google Takeout (available for users enrolled in&nbsp;Google@UH Consumer Apps)    Download files from the web (https://drive.google.com/) to your local computer, external storage media, or another cloud storage account    Use Google Drive for Desktop to copy/paste or drag/drop files to your local computer, external storage media, or another cloud storage accountPhotos    Google Takeout (available for users enrolled in&nbsp;Google@UH Consumer Apps)    Download files from the web (https://photos.google.com/) to your local computer, external storage media, or another cloud storage account    Set up&nbsp;Partner Sharing&nbsp;to transfer Google Photos to a personal Google account. After setting up Partner Sharing, follow Google's instructions in the &quot;Save your partner's photos&quot; section to create a copy of photos in your personal account. Then, delete the photos from your hawaii.edu account. Remember, you need to empty your Google Photos' Trash in order to reclaim storage space used by deleted photos.&nbsp;Can I transfer my data directly to a personal Google account?You can transfer emails from Gmail and most Drive files to a personal Google account using Google Takeout Transfer. One benefit of transfering data to a personal Google account is that Google offers personal @gmail.com users 15 GB of storage for free. Doubling the storage allotted to your Google@UH account.If you plan to use Google Takeout Transfer, keep in mind the following:    You will need to enroll in&nbsp;Google@UH Consumer Apps    You may need to purchase a Google One plan if you need storage beyond the 15 GB provided with to a free personal Google account.    After the transfer is complete you will still need to delete data from your Google@UH account in order to reduce your storage use.Refer to the Google guide&nbsp;Copy content from your school account to another account&nbsp;for detailed instructions on performing the Takeout Transfer.Note, you cannot directly transfer Google Photos to a personal Google account using Takeout Transfer. Instead, refer to one of the options listed above to transfer photos: use Takeout to download a copy of Photos, download Photos directly from the web, or set up Partner Sharing.&nbsp;Does Shared Drive storage count against my individual storage quota?No, Shared Drives have their own storage quotas and storage used by a Shared Drive does not count towards an individual's storage quota. Storage used by Shared Drives does, however, count towards our Google domain's total pooled storage limit. See below for information on changing the manager of a Shared Drive.'Ohana users (and those in the 180 day grace period) who are managers of a Shared Drive should transfer managership of Shared Drive to an active faculty, staff, student, or other affiliate, as Shared Drives that are not managed by an active faculty, staff, student, or other affiliate may be deleted.How do I delete a Shared Drive?You must have manager access and the shared drive has to be empty. (You must delete the files first or move them to &quot;my drive&quot;)    On your computer, go to drive.google.com.    On the left, click Shared drives.    Right-click the shared drive you want to delete.    Click Delete shared drive.&nbsp;How do I transfer manager of a Shared Drive?First navigate to the list of Shared Drives that you manage or are a member of by visiting&nbsp;https://drive.google.com/drive/shared-drives. Next, click once to select the Shared Drive you'd like to check the membership of. After selecting a Shared Drive, click on the&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;View details&quot; icon in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. In the &quot;details pane&quot; that appears click on &quot;Manage access&quot; to view the membership of the Shared Drive.For each drive you are a Manager of, add a new manager by entering their email address in the &quot;Add people and groups&quot; and clicking on the email address.

    "question": "Multi-Factor Authentication Requirement for UH Faculty, Students, and Staff",
    "answer": "The US Department of Education Federal Student Aid Office has notified higher education institutions that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) amended their Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information (Safeguards Rule) component of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of these amended GLBA requirements, and to safeguard personal information of consumers, UH Information Technology Services (ITS) will be requiring all active students, faculty and staff to enroll in Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)&nbsp;in order to access the University's online services (e.g., Google@UH, STAR, Laulima, MyUH, etc.). This requirement will go into effect on October 2, 2023.The new GLBA requirements are beneficial. UH has been experiencing ongoing brute force and credential stuffing attacks by cyber criminals attempting to gain access to UH usernames. Since January 1, 2023 we have averaged 20.5 attacks a month, resulting in over 52,000 login attempts in which over 49,000 users have been targeted that resulted in 35 successful logins. Duo MFA provides additional protections from unauthorized access to your UH username. Duo MFA has been available to UH users since 2016.Affected UsersAll active students, faculty, staff, and affiliates will be required to enroll in MFA by October 2, 2023. For required users, failing to enroll by October 2, 2023 will result in loss of access to UH services.Alumni, retirees, and Departmental or Organizational UH Usernames will not be required to enroll in Duo MFA.SEED (Na Kapuna) participants are not required to enroll in Duo MFA.Beginning in Fall 2023, users who have already enrolled in MFA (including alumni and retirees) will be unable to opt out.

What is Duo?    Am I required to enroll in MFA?    How do I check if I am already enrolled in MFA?    How do I enroll in MFA?    What happens if I don't enroll in MFA by October 2, 2023?    What methods are available to authenticate with Duo MFA?    What if I am unable to or don't want to enroll in MFA using my smartphone as my second factor?    What if I don't have access to any authentication methods?    Can I request an exception to the MFA requirement?    Can I opt-out once enrolled in MFA?What is MFA? What is Duo?Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) provides a layered approach to secure access to online accounts by requiring a user to present two (or more) distinct identifying &quot;factors&quot; before access is granted to the account or online resource. The first factor is commonly referred to as &quot;something you know&quot;. At UH, this &quot;something you know&quot; would be your normal UH Login credentials (UH Username and password). This &quot;something you know&quot; username and password combination has been the most common method for authentication in the industry for decades, but has significant security weaknesses: used as the sole factor for authentication, this method is susceptible to brute force, credential stuffing, and phishing attacks and should a user's credentials be compromised, would allow immediate access to an attacker.Multi-Factor Authentication helps protect against these common types of attacks by also requiring a second factor, commonly referred to as &quot;something you have&quot;, at login. This &quot;something you have&quot; is routinely something you possess - a mobile phone, tablet, landline, or physical token. When using MFA, a user will be asked for both their first factor and second factor before access is granted to the account or online resource. Confirmation that you are in possession of your second factor device and are permitting a log in is normally accomplished by requiring active interaction with the device (responding to a push notificiation on your smartphone or entering a passcode that was recieved via SMS, etc.).&nbsp;As an example, consider that you've been using Multi-Factor Authentication each and every time you withdraw cash at an ATM. First, you present your debit card (&quot;something you have&quot;) to the ATM. Next, you are asked to input your PIN (&quot;something you know&quot;). If either factor cannot be provided, access to your account is not granted and your money cannot be withdrawn. This makes it more difficult for a bad actor who has stolen your wallet (and thus only has one factor) from being able to withdraw your money from an ATM. You may also already be familiar with MFA as its use has become more widespread and ubiquitous for many online services from social media to online banking to gaming and entertainment.Duo is the service that UH (and many other higher-ed institutions) uses to provide Multi-Factor Authentication. Duo provides a mature platform with several second factor methods and integrates seamlessly with UH Login.Am I required to enroll in MFA?All active Faculty, Staff, Students, Prestudents, Affiliates (Including Postdocs), and Emeritus are required to enroll in MFA.Former students/alumnus, former faculty/staff, and retirees are not required to enroll in MFA, but may elect to enroll in MFA. However, once enrolled, there is no option to opt-out.Departmental and Organizational UH Username are not required to enroll in MFA, but owners of these types of accounts may elect to enroll the account in MFA to help increase security.&nbsp;SEED (Na Kapuna) participants are not required to enroll in Duo MFA.Refer to Affected Users&nbsp;above to view this information in table format.&nbsp;How do I check if I am already enrolled in MFA?To check if you are enrolled in MFA, please go to the Device Registration Page.Not enrolledIf you have not yet enrolled in MFA, you will see a prompt to &quot;Protect Your University of Hawaii Account&quot; with a &quot;Start setup&quot; button present. At this point, you can begin your enrollment by clicking on &quot;Start Setup&quot;. Please visit the the following AskUs article for step-by-step instructions on setting up your first device: https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1681.EnrolledIf you are already enrolled in MFA, you will see a prompt to test your existing second-factor authentication device(s). If you'd like to add a new second-factor device or adjust your devices and settings, you can do so by selecting &quot;Add a new device&quot; or &quot;My Settings &amp; Devices&quot; from the left-hand menu. Otherwise, you can close your browser tab or window after confirming your enrollment.If you require any assistance determining if you are enrolled in MFA, please contact the&nbsp;ITS Help Desk.How do I enroll in MFA?To begin enrollment, please visit the the&nbsp;Device Registration Page. For instructions on enrolling in Duo MFA, refer to our &quot;Getting setup for Multi-Factor Authentication&quot; article.*Note that several authentication methods are listed in the first section which you can select per your preference. ITS recommends Duo Push through the Duo Mobile app. It is also strongly recommended that you register at least two devices for MFA. By registering two devices, if one of your devices becomes unavailable (e.g if your phone is forgotten or lost), you still have another option to use for authentication.If you require any assistance enrolling in MFA, please contact the&nbsp;ITS Help Desk.What happens if I don't enroll in MFA by October 2, 2023?Users who are required to enroll in Duo MFA but fail to do so by the October 2, 2023 deadline will be routed to the Duo MFA enrollment page upon their next login. UH online services that require authentication via UH Login will be inaccessible until users complete their MFA enrollment.UH online services that will be inaccessible should users fail to enroll in Duo MFA include, but are not limited to, Laulima, Google@UH apps (including Gmail, Drive, Calendar, etc.), UH Username Management, Financial aid information, Student Employment, Kuali Financial System, Banner, UH Enterprise Dropbox, Peoplesoft, TAPS, eTravel, and Leave.What methods can I use to authenticate? What options are avaialble to use as my second factor(s)?UH Login supports for the following MFA methods and second factor devices:    Duo Push, using the Duo Mobile app on a mobile device (smartphone or tablet)    Duo Passcode, using the Duo Mobile app on a mobile device (smartphone or tablet)    Phone Call, using either a mobile phone or landline    SMS Passcodes, using a mobile phone that supports SMS (text messaging)    Yubikey Hard Token, which is inserted into your computer's USB portITS highly recommends Duo Push as the primary method when authenticating. We also highly recommend that users configure at least two (2) second factor devices. In this way, should a user forget or lose one of their factors (smartphone, for example), they will have an additional method to use to authenticate (landline or tablet, for example). Users can configure multiple second factor devices.For more information on the different methods you can use and the requirements and considerations for each method, please refer to our &quot;Which authentication method should I use?&quot; article.What if I am unable to or don't want to enroll in MFA using my smartphone as my second factor?While ITS highly recommends the use of Duo Push via the Duo Mobile app, there are other methods available to those who do not own a smartphone, such as registering an iOS or Android tablet, registering a hard token, or registering a landline or non-smartphone and authenticating via phone call or SMS.Option 1: LandlineFor individuals without access to a smartphone, you can authenticate logins by using the Call Me option on a landline at home phone or office phone. To see how to setup this method, see https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1681#landline2.Option 2: TabletFor individuals with a tablet or other smart device without a phone plan, as long as your device has internet connection you can authenticate through the Duo Mobile app by using the Push method. Once the Duo Mobile app is installed and setup, authentication can be performed via Duo Passcode even if your device loses internet connection.
